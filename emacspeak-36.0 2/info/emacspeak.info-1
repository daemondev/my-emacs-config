2.1 How To Contribute To This Manual
====================================

This manual is organized as a series of chapters, with each chapter in a
separate file.  If you feel capable of contributing to a specific
section, send out a message to the Emacspeak mailing list
`emacspeak@cs.vassar.edu'.  You can then start adding content to a
local copy of the chapter to which you are contributing.  When you feel
you have something to submit, mail out the file to the emacspeak
mailing list- I'll integrate new content as it comes in.

2.2 Authoring Guidelines
========================

For this manual to hang together and make sense to the new user at whom
it is targeted, contributors need to stick to a consistent style.  If
you plan to contribute content, you should take some time to read the
existing sections -note that many of these are skeletal and the first
contributions will be to flesh these sections out.

   If you are familiar with texinfo, go ahead and mark up your content
using texinfo.  If you are not, simply author the documentation you
create as plain formatted ASCII.  If you do submit files as texinfo
source, make sure to validate them at your end first by running the
files through `makeinfo' -badly created or malformed texinfo source
takes more time to fix than marking up straight text.

3 Introduction
**************

Emacspeak provides a complete audio desktop by speech-enabling all of
Emacs.

   In the past, screen reading programs have allowed visually impaired
users to get feedback using synthesized speech. Such programs have been
commercially available for well over a decade. Most of them run on PC's
under DOS, and these are now moving over to the Windows environment.
However, screen-readers for the UNIX environment have been conspicuous
in their absence.  Note that this is now changing with the availability
of console-level Linux screenreaders such as `speakup'.  Such Linux
screenreaders provide the same level of UNIX accessibility provided in
the late 80's by PC terminal emulators running a DOS screenreader.  This
means that most visually impaired computer users face the additional
handicap of being DOS-impaired -- a far more serious problem:-)

   Emacspeak is an emacs subsystem that provides complete speech access.
It is _not_ a screen-reader --rather, it is a complete user environment
with built-in speech  feedback.  Emacspeak has a significant advantage;
since it runs inside Emacs, a structure-sensitive, fully customizable
environment, Emacspeak has more context-specific information about what
it is speaking than its screenreader counterparts.  This is why
Emacspeak is not a "screenreader", it is a subsystem that produces
speech output.

   A Traditional screen-reader speaks the content of the screen,
leaving it to the user to interpret the visual layout.  Emacspeak, on
the other hand, treats speech as a first-class output modality; it
speaks the information in a manner that is easy to comprehend when
listening.

   The basic concepts used by Emacspeak are simple; all interactive
Emacs commands have been adapted to provide speech feedback.  Hence, you
use Emacs as normal; Emacspeak works behind the scene to give audio
feedback in addition to updating the screen.

   Emacspeak consists of a core speech system that provides speech and
audio services to the rest of the Emacspeak desktop;
application-specific extensions provide context-specific spoken feedback
using these services.  Emacspeak currently comes with speech extensions
for several popular Emacs subsystems and editing modes.  I would like to
thank their respective authors for their wonderful work which makes
Emacs more than a text editor(1)..

   ---------- Footnotes ----------

   (1)  I have now been using Emacspeak under Linux as the only source
of speech feedback since 1994.

4.2 Quick Installation
======================

Here are the quick installation instructions.  See the next section for
detailed installation instructions.

   Prepackaged RPM files are available on the Emacspeak site.  Packages
for other Linux distributions such as Debian typically become available
on the WWW a few days after a new version is released.  The
instructions below are for building and installing Emacspeak from the
source distribution.

   *  Type `make config' to configure the sources for your site.

   *  Type `make' to compile the files.

   * Install the system by typing `make install'

   *  Run it by doing one of:
        * `emacspeak'

        * Add the line
               (load-file "<emacspeak-dir>/lisp/emacspeak-setup.el")
          to the top of your .emacs file.

        *  In the above, `<emacspeak-dir>' refers to the directory
     where you unpacked the sources.


File: emacspeak.info,  Node: Configuring and Installing Emacspeak,  Prev: Quick Installation,  Up: Installation

4.3 Configuring and Installing Emacspeak
========================================

Note: You need a current version of GNU Emacs   for using newer
versions of Emacspeak.

   The speech server for the Dectalk is written in TclX.  (For example,
see the source file `dtk-exp').
   * Decide where you want the Emacspeak elisp files.  Most Unix
     packages are unpacked and compiled in one directory, and then the
     executable, documentation, and data files are installed in the
     appropriate system directories.

     Once you have decided on the appropriate directory, make it if
     necessary and unpack the distribution `.tar' file there.

   * Look through the introductory section of the Makefile to see if
     you need to edit it for your site.

   * Check the directory prefix for installation.  The default is
     `/usr/local', so `.info' files go to `/usr/local/info' and the
     executable file goes to `/usr/local/bin'.  To change this, edit
     the line defining PREFIX.

   Configure the source files by typing `make config'.  At this point
you can check that the  speech server is correctly configured by typing
     tcl dtk-exp
   (assuming you are using the Dectalk Express).  You should hear the
Dectalk speak and get a TCL prompt if everything is okay.

   If you're feeling paranoid, you can perform a couple of additional
tests at this point. Execute the following commands in the running tcl
session you just started above.  (Most users will not need to do this;
it is a sanity check and is useful in tracking problems, especially if
you find emacspeak beginning to talk and then immediately fall silent.)

   *      q "this is a test."
          d

     You should hear the Dectalk speak  the text.

   * `s'  The above command stops speech.   You should see a TCL prompt
     when you execute it.    If things appear to hang when you execute
     `s'   i.e. you don't see a TCL prompt
       1. The serial cable connecting your speech device is flaky

       2. Your serial port is flaky

       3. The stty settings on the port are incorrect for your system

     In the case of incorrect stty settings please report the problem.
     The following UNIX command can be used to report the stty settings:
          stty -a < serial_port


   Quit this TCL session by typing `C-D'.

   Next, compile the elisp files by typing
     make emacspeak
   Finally, install the documentation and executable files by typing
     make PREFIX=<prefix> install

   The speech server program and/or output port can also be specified
at run time by setting the shell environment variables DTK_PROGRAM and
DTK_PORT.  Examples: If using `csh' or `tcsh'
     setenv DTK_PROGRAM "dtk-exp"
   if using `sh' or `bash'
     DTK_PROGRAM=dtk-exp
     export DTK_PROGRAM
   Similarly,
     DTK_PORT=/dev/ttyS0

   You can always set these variables from a running Emacs session by
executing the Emacs setenv command.

5 Basic Usage.
**************

This chapter gives an overview of how to use Emacspeak.  Note: This
documentation should be used in conjunction with the online Emacs info
pages that extensively document Emacs itself.  These sections briefly
describe the speech-enabling extensions.  However, they should not be
considered a substitute for reading the Emacs manual.  How successfully
you use Emacspeak will depend on how well you learn your Emacs.

   All Emacs navigation and editing commands have been speech enabled.
Thus, moving to the next or previous word, line or paragraph results in
the text around point being spoken.  Exactly how much text is spoken is
determined by the amount by which you moved.

   In addition, Emacspeak provides  basic reading functions that can be
invoked to listen to chunks of text without moving.

File: emacspeak.info,  Node: Overview,  Next: Working,  Up: Basic Usage

5.1 Overview of Emacspeak
=========================

Emacspeak provides a small number of core services around which the
remainder of the audio interface is constructed.  These essential
features of the software are briefly outlined in the following
paragraphs; the commands by which they can be controlled will be
described later in the manual.

   Apart from providing a fluent spoken interface to all of Emacs' basic
editing functions, Emacspeak also includes software modules which add
speech feedback to a range of applications that can be run from within
Emacs. In this sense, Emacspeak amounts to much more than a talking
text editor; indeed, it can more aptly be characterized as a true
"audio desktop", in which speech is treated as a first-class output
modality.

   Emacspeak implements a special minor mode, known as "voice lock
mode" (*note Voice-lock::) which uses distinct speech characteristics
to provide aural highlighting of specific textual constructs, such as
comments in program code, quoted strings and reserved words *Note Voice
Lock::. This facility is further extended when Emacspeak is used with
the W3 World Wide Web browser, to enable the semantic and structural
distinctions captured by the HTML markup to be communicated efficiently
*Note Web Browsing::.

   It is often desirable to exercise control over the pronunciation of a
word (E.G. a technical term or a reserved word in a programming
language) within specific contexts. Emacspeak maintains pronunciation
dictionaries for this purpose, which may be customized by the user.
Moreover, individual dictionaries can be activated selectively,
depending for example on the current major mode or the name of the file
which is being visited *Note emacspeak-pronounce::.

   In addition to spoken feedback, Emacspeak can generate "auditory
icons"--short sound cues which alert the user to significant events,
for example the opening or deletion of a file, the completion of an
action, the arrival of an electronic mail message or the creation of a
completion buffer. Sound cues act as a supplement to the spoken
interface, and are especially valuable to the experienced user in
facilitating rapid interaction. Note that in order to support auditory
icons, the computer must be equipped with sound hardware for which the
operating system has been correctly configured *Note emacspeak-sounds::.

5.2 Working In Emacs Buffers.
=============================

While typing in an Emacs buffer, hitting space  speaks  the recently
typed word.  I use  completion all the time; so Emacspeak will speak the
completion just inserted as well as the next possible completion.  In
Emacs, use `load-library ret completion ret' for loading the completion
package.

   The standard Emacs prompting functions have also been speech-enabled.
Emacs prompts with available lists of completions in response to partial
input wherever appropriate --all forms of completion provide speech
feedback.

   In addition, Emacspeak provides a number of commands for reading
portions of the current buffer, getting status information, and
modifying Emacspeak's state.

   All of the commands are documented in the subsequent sections.  They
can be classified into types:

   *  Emacspeak commands for listening to chunks of information.  The
     names  of these commands all start with the common prefix
     `emacspeak-speak-'.  All Emacspeak commands are bound to the
     keymap EMACSPEAK-KEYMAP and are accessed with the key  `Control
     e'(1).  Thus,  the Emacspeak command "emacspeak-speak-line" is
     bound to `l' in  keymap EMACSPEAK-KEYMAP and can be accessed with
     the keystroke  `Control-e l'.  If for some reason you wish to use
     some key other  than `control-e' as the common keyboard prefix for
     all Emacspeak  commands, set the variable EMACSPEAK-PREFIX.

   *   The second category of commands provided by Emacspeak manipulate
     the state of the speech device.   The names of these commands
     start with the common prefix `dtk-' and are bound in keymap
     EMACSPEAK-DTK-SUBMAP.   You can access these commands via the
     prefix `Control-e d'(2).  Thus, the command "dtk-set-rate" is
     bound to `r'  in keymap EMACSPEAK-DTK-SUBMAP and can be executed by
     pressing `Control e d r'.

   Emacs has extensive online help; so does emacspeak.   Please use it.

   This info manual is only to get you started.  You can get a summary
of Emacspeak's features by pressing `Control-h Control-e'

   ---------- Footnotes ----------

   (1)  Control e is mnemonic for Emacspeak.

   (2) d is mnemonic for Dectalk.

5.3 Reading Without Moving The Cursor.
======================================

Emacspeak speaks information as you move around within a buffer.  How
much text is spoken depends on how you move, thus, when you move by
words, you hear the current word; when you move by paragraphs, you hear
the current paragraph spoken.  In addition, the following commands allow
you to listen to information without moving point (point is emacs
terminology for the editing cursor).

   Reading without moving point:
` control e c '
     emacspeak-speak-char  Speak character under point.  Pronounces
     character phonetically unless  called with a PREFIX arg.

` control e w '
     emacspeak-speak-word  Speak current word.  With prefix ARG, speaks
     the rest of the word from point.  Negative prefix arg speaks from
     start of word to point.  If executed  on the same buffer position
     a second time, the word is spelled instead of being spoken.

` control e l '
     emacspeak-speak-line  Speaks current line.  With prefix ARG,
     speaks the rest of the line from point.  Negative prefix optional
     arg speaks from start of line   to point.  Voicifies if option
     `voice-lock-mode' is on.  Indicates   indentation with a tone if
     audio indentation is in use.  Indicates   position of point with
     an aural highlight if option   `emacspeak-show-point' is turned on
     -see command `emacspeak-show-point'   bound to M-x
     emacspeak-show-point.  Lines that start hidden blocks of text,
     e.g.  outline header lines, or header lines of blocks created by
     command `emacspeak-hide-or-expose-block' are indicated with
     auditory icon ellipses.

` control e up '
     emacspeak-read-previous-line  Read previous line, specified by an
     offset, without moving.  Default is to read the previous line.

` control e down '
     emacspeak-read-next-line  Read next line, specified by an offset,
     without moving.  Default is to read the next line.

` control e {'
     emacspeak-speak-paragraph  Speak paragraph.  With prefix arg,
     speaks rest of current paragraph.  Negative prefix arg will read
     from start of current paragraph to point.  If voice-lock-mode is
     on, then it will use any defined personality.

` control e r '
     emacspeak-speak-region  Speak current region delimited by "point"
     and "mark".  When called from a program, argument START  and END
     specify region to speak.

` control e  cap R  '
     emacspeak-speak-rectangle  Speak a rectangle of text.  Rectangle
     is delimited by point and mark.  When call from a program,
     arguments specify the START and END of the rectangle.

` control e b '
     emacspeak-speak-buffer  Speak current buffer  contents.  With
     prefix ARG, speaks the rest of the buffer from point.  Negative
     prefix arg speaks from start of buffer to point.   If voice lock
     mode is on, the paragraphs in the buffer are voice annotated
     first,  see command `emacspeak-speak-voice-annotate-paragraphs'.

` control e n '
     emacspeak-speak-rest-of-buffer  Speak remainder of the buffer
     starting at point

` control e / '
     emacspeak-speak-this-buffer-other-window-display  Speak this
     buffer as displayed in a different frame.  Emacs allows you to
     display the same buffer in multiple windows or frames.  These
     different windows can display different portions of the buffer.
     This is equivalent to leaving a book open at places at once.  This
     command allows you to listen to the places where you have left the
     book open.  The number used to invoke this command specifies which
     of the displays you wish to speak.  Typically you will have two or
     at most three such displays open.  The current display is 0, the
     next is 1, and so on.  Optional argument ARG specifies the display
     to speak.

` control e left '
     emacspeak-speak-this-buffer-previous-display  Speak this buffer as
     displayed in a `previous' window.  See documentation for command
     `emacspeak-speak-this-buffer-other-window-display' for the meaning
     of `previous'.

` control e right '
     emacspeak-speak-this-buffer-next-display  Speak this buffer as
     displayed in a `previous' window.  See documentation for command
     `emacspeak-speak-this-buffer-other-window-display' for the meaning
     of `previous'.

` control e [ '
     emacspeak-speak-page  Speak a page.  With prefix ARG, speaks rest
     of current page.  Negative prefix arg will read from start of
     current page to point.  If option  `voice-lock-mode' is on, then
     it will use any defined personality.

` control e 9   control e 8   control e 7   control e 6   control e 5   control e 4   control e 3   control e 2   control e 1   control e 0 '
     emacspeak-speak-predefined-window  Speak one of the first 10
     windows on the screen.  In general, you'll never have Emacs split
     the screen into more than two or three.  Argument ARG determines
     the 'other' window to speak.   Speaks entire window irrespective
     of point.  Semantics  of `other' is the same as for the builtin
     Emacs command `other-window'.

` control e control n '
     emacspeak-speak-next-window  Speak the next window.

` control e control p '
     emacspeak-speak-previous-window  Speak the previous window.

` control e control o '
     emacspeak-speak-other-window  Speak contents of `other' window.
     Speaks entire window irrespective of point.  Semantics  of `other'
     is the same as for the builtin Emacs command `other-window'.
     Optional argument ARG  specifies `other' window to speak.

` ESCAPE up '
     emacspeak-owindow-previous-line  Move to the next line in the
     other window and speak it.  Numeric prefix arg COUNT specifies
     number of lines to move.

` ESCAPE down '
     emacspeak-owindow-next-line  Move to the next line in the other
     window and speak it.  Numeric prefix arg COUNT can specify number
     of lines to move.

` ESCAPE next '
     emacspeak-owindow-scroll-up  Scroll up the window that command
     `other-window' would move to.  Speak the window contents after
     scrolling.

` ESCAPE prior '
     emacspeak-owindow-scroll-down  Scroll down  the window that
     command `other-window' would move to.  Speak the window contents
     after scrolling.

` control e ' '
     emacspeak-speak-sexp  Speak current sexp.  With prefix ARG, speaks
     the rest of the sexp  from point.  Negative prefix arg speaks from
     start of sexp to point.  If option  `voice-lock-mode' is on, then
     uses the personality.

` control e meta control @ '
     emacspeak-speak-spaces-at-point  Speak the white space at point.

5.4 Speech System Commands
==========================

This section documents Emacspeak's  various user commands for
controlling the text to speech (TTS) system.

* Menu:

* Controlling Echo::             Character, Word and Line Echo.
* Speech Output  Control::       Indicating case, capitalization and indentation.
* Miscellaneous:: Miscellaneous TTS Commands.


File: emacspeak.info,  Node: Controlling Echo,  Next: Speech Output Control,  Up: Speech System

5.4.1 Character, Word And Line Echo.
------------------------------------

By default, Emacspeak speaks characters as they are typed -this is
called character echo; Words are spoken as they are completed -this is
called word echo.  Emacspeak can also optionally speak each line as it
is typed -this is called line echo.

   Character, word and line echo can be toggled -either in the current
buffer- or for all buffers (globally).  To toggle the specific echo
functionality for all buffers, precede the specific command with `C-u'.
Note that in the documentation below, this use of `C-u' is indicated
using the common Emacs terminology of _prefix arg_ or _interactive
prefix arg_.

`control e d k '
     emacspeak-toggle-character-echo  Toggle state of  Emacspeak
     character echo.  Interactive PREFIX arg means toggle  the global
     default value, and then set the current local  value to the result.

` control e d w '
     emacspeak-toggle-word-echo  Toggle state of  Emacspeak  word echo.
     Interactive PREFIX arg means toggle  the global default value, and
     then set the current local  value to the result.

` control e d l '
     emacspeak-toggle-line-echo  Toggle state of  Emacspeak  line echo.
     Interactive PREFIX arg means toggle  the global default value, and
     then set the current local  value to the result.


File: emacspeak.info,  Node: Speech Output Control,  Next: Miscellaneous,  Prev: Controlling Echo,  Up: Speech System

5.4.2 Setting Various Characteristics Of Speech Output.
-------------------------------------------------------

Emacspeak user commands can set different characteristics of the speech
output such as speech rate and  punctuations mode.

   Emacspeak provides a number of settings that affect how  attributes
of the text such as capitalization are conveyed.  These include
settings that produce a short tone for each upper case letter,  as well
as a smart mode for speaking mixed case words which is especially
useful when programming.  These settings can be made locally in a given
buffer or be applied to all buffers by preceding these commands with
`C-u'.

` control e d r '
     dtk-set-rate  Set speaking RATE for the tts.  Interactive PREFIX
     arg means set   the global default value, and then set the current
     local  value to the result.

` control e d f '
     dtk-set-character-scale  Set scale FACTOR for   speech rate.
     Speech rate is scaled by this factor when speaking characters.
     Interactive PREFIX arg means set   the global default value, and
     then set the current local  value to the result.

     This function is advised.

     Before-advice `emacspeak-auto': Automatically defined advice to
     speak interactive prompts.

` control e d 9   control e d 8   control e d 7   control e d 6   control e d 5   control e d 4   control e d 3   control e d 2   control e d 1   control e d 0 '
     dtk-set-predefined-speech-rate  Set speech rate to one of nine
     predefined levels.  Interactive PREFIX arg says to set the rate
     globally.

` control e d p '
     dtk-set-punctuations  Set punctuation mode to MODE.  Possible
     values are `some', `all', or `none'.  Interactive PREFIX arg means
     set   the global default value, and then set the current local
     value to the result.

` control e d m '
     dtk-set-pronunciation-mode  Set pronunciation MODE.  This command
     is valid only for newer Dectalks, e.g.  the Dectalk Express.
     Possible values are `math, name, europe, spell', all of which can
     be turned on or off.  Argument STATE specifies new state.

` control e d s '
     dtk-toggle-split-caps  Toggle split caps mode.  Split caps mode is
     useful when reading Hungarian notation in program source code.
     Interactive PREFIX arg means toggle the global default value, and
     then set the current local value to the result.

` control e d c '
     dtk-toggle-capitalization  Toggle capitalization.  when set,
     capitalization is indicated by a short beep.  Interactive PREFIX
     arg means toggle the global default value, and then set the
     current local value to the result.

` control e d  cap C  '
     dtk-toggle-allcaps-beep  Toggle allcaps-beep.  when set, allcaps
     words  are  indicated by a short beep.  Interactive PREFIX arg
     means toggle the global default value, and then set the current
     local value to the result.  Note that allcaps-beep is a very
     useful thing when programming.  However it is irritating to have
     it on when reading documents.

   In addition, Emacspeak can convey the indentation of lines as they
are spoken- this is relevant when programming  and is the default when
working with program source.

` control e d i '
     emacspeak-toggle-audio-indentation  Toggle state of  Emacspeak
     audio indentation.  Interactive PREFIX arg means toggle  the
     global default value, and then set the current local  value to the
     result.  Specifying the method of indentation as `tones' results
     in the Dectalk producing a tone whose length is a function of the
     line's indentation.  Specifying `speak' results in the number of
     initial spaces being spoken.

     Indentation feedback style is set by option
     emacspeak-audio-indentation-method 

     The default value is  `"speak"'

     See variable `emacspeak-audio-indentation-methods' for possible
     values.  Automatically becomes local in any buffer where it is set.

5.4.3 Miscellaneous Speech Commands
-----------------------------------

Speech can be stopped using command `dtk-stop' -though in normal use,
the action of moving the cursor will stop ongoing speech. Speech can
also be paused and resumed.  The speech server can be stopped and
restarted for cases where the user wants to switch to a different
server -or in the rare case to nuke a runaway speech server.

`Control e s'
     dtk-stop  Stop speech now.

` control e p '
     dtk-pause  Pause ongoing speech.  The speech can be resumed with
     command `dtk-resume' normally bound to C-e SPC.  Pausing speech is
     useful when one needs to perform a few actions before continuing
     to read a large document.  Emacspeak gives you speech feedback as
     usual once speech has been paused.  `dtk-resume' continues the
     interrupted speech irrespective of the buffer in which it is
     executed.  Optional PREFIX arg flushes any previously paused
     speech.

` control e SPACE '
     dtk-resume  Resume paused speech.  This command resumes  speech
     that has been suspended by executing command `dtk-pause' bound to
     C-e p.  If speech has not been paused, and variable
     `dtk-resume-should-toggle' is t  then this command will pause
     ongoing speech.

` control e d q '
     dtk-toggle-quiet  Toggle state of the speech device between being
     quiet and talkative.  Useful if you want to continue using an
     Emacs session that has emacspeak loaded but wish to make the
     speech shut up.  Optional argument PREFIX specifies whether speech
     is turned off in the current buffer or in all buffers.

` control e control s '
     dtk-emergency-restart  Use this to nuke the currently running dtk
     server and restart it.  Useful if you want to switch to another
     synthesizer while emacspeak is running.  Also useful for emergency
     stopping of speech.


   Finally, here are the remaining commands available via the TTS
related keymap `C-e d'.

` control e d a '
     dtk-add-cleanup-pattern  Add this pattern to the list of repeating
     patterns that are cleaned up.  Optional interactive prefix arg
     deletes  this pattern if previously added.  Cleaning up repeated
     patterns results in emacspeak speaking the pattern followed by a
     repeat count instead of speaking all the characters making up the
     pattern.  Thus, by adding the repeating pattern `.' (this is
     already added by default) emacspeak will say "aw fifteen dot" when
     speaking the string "..............." instead of "period period
     period period ".

` control e d d '
     dtk-select-server  Select a speech server interactively.  This
     will be the server that is used when you next call either M-x
     dtk-initialize or C-e C-s.  Argument PROGRAM specifies the speech
     server program.

` control e d SPACE '
     dtk-toggle-splitting-on-white-space  Toggle splitting of speech on
     white space.  This affects the internal state of emacspeak that
     decides if we split text purely by clause boundaries, or also
     include whitespace.  By default, emacspeak sends a clause at a time
     to the speech device.  This produces fluent speech for normal use.
     However in modes such as `shell-mode' and some programming
     language modes, clause markers appear infrequently, and this can
     result in large amounts of text being sent to the speech device at
     once, making the system unresponsive when asked to stop talking.
     Splitting on white space makes emacspeak's stop command
     responsive.  However, when splitting on white space, the speech
     sounds choppy since the synthesizer is getting a word at a time.

` control e d RETURN '
     dtk-set-chunk-separator-syntax  Interactively set how text is
     split in chunks.  See the Emacs documentation on syntax tables for
     details on how characters are classified into various syntactic
     classes.  Argument S specifies the syntax class.

` control e d t '
     emacspeak-dial-dtk  Prompt for and dial a phone NUMBER with the
     Dectalk.

` control e d  cap V  '
     emacspeak-dtk-speak-version  Use this to find out which version of
     the TTS firmware you are running.

` control e d z '
     emacspeak-zap-dtk  Send this command to the TTS engine  directly.

5.5 Voice Lock Mode
===================

The status of voice lock mode can be toggled on and off by issuing the
command `C-e d v (M-x voice-lock-mode)'. With a prefix arg, this
function applies globally; otherwise, it is local to the current
buffer. To have voice lock mode activated automatically when Emacspeak
starts, include the following code in your `.emacs' file:

     (add-hook 'emacs-lisp-mode-hook
     'turn-on-voice-lock)

   Alternatively, Emacspeak can be set to enable voice lock
automatically in all of the major modes that support it. To do so,
insert the following statement into your Emacs initialization file:

     (global-voice-lock-mode t)

   Note that the list of major modes in which `global-voice-lock-mode'
will provide automatic activation is specified in the variable
VOICE-LOCK-GLOBAL-MODES *Note Voice Lock::.

   The characteristics of the different voice personalities deployed by
voice lock mode vary according to the capabilities of the speech
synthesizer. The definitions applicable to the Dectalk family of
synthesizers are contained in `dtk-voices.el', which is supplied as
part of the Emacspeak distribution.

   Using voice lock mode, Emacspeak also supports many of the aural
style properties defined in level 2 of the World Wide Web Consortium's
Cascading Style Sheet specification (see
`http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-CSS2/'. Thus, when Emacspeak is running in
conjunction with a cooperating user agent, such as William Perry's
Emacspeak/W3 web browser, the rendering of HTML documents can be
regulated by style sheets. Examples of style rules which employ the CSS
audio properties can be found in the default style sheet which is
supplied in the Emacs/W3 distribution.

The following commands provide miscellaneous information.
` control e a '
     emacspeak-speak-message-again  Speak the last message from Emacs
     once again.

` control e m '
     emacspeak-speak-mode-line  Speak the mode-line.

` control e  cap M  '
     emacspeak-speak-minor-mode-line  Speak the minor mode-information.

` control e control w '
     emacspeak-speak-window-information  Speaks information about
     current windows.

` control e t '
     emacspeak-speak-time  Speak the time.

` control e cap V '
     emacspeak-speak-version  Announce version information for running
     emacspeak.

` control e f '
     emacspeak-speak-buffer-filename  Speak name of file being visited
     in current buffer.  Speak default directory if invoked in a dired
     buffer, or when the buffer is not visiting any file.

` control e h '
     emacspeak-speak-help  Speak help buffer if one present.  With
     prefix arg, speaks the rest of the buffer from point.  Negative
     prefix arg speaks from start of buffer to point.

` control e k '
     emacspeak-speak-current-kill  Speak the current kill entry.  This
     is the text that will be yanked in by the next C-y.  Prefix
     numeric arg, COUNT, specifies that the text that will be yanked as
     a result of a C-y  followed by count-1 M-y be spoken.   The kill
     number that is spoken says what numeric prefix arg to give to
     command `yank'.

` control e v '
     emacspeak-view-register  Display the contents of a register, and
     then speak it.

` control e control @ '
     emacspeak-speak-current-mark  Speak the line containing the mark.
     With no argument, speaks the line containing the mark-this is
     where `exchange-point-and-mark' C-x C-x would jump.  Numeric
     prefix arg 'COUNT' speaks line containing mark 'n' where 'n' is
     one less than the number of times one has to jump using
     `set-mark-command' to get to this marked position.  The location
     of the mark is indicated by an aural highlight achieved by a
     change in voice personality.

` control e control l '
     emacspeak-speak-line-number  Speak the line number of the current
     line.

` control e = '
     emacspeak-speak-current-column  Speak the current column.

6 The Emacspeak Audio Desktop.
******************************

This chapter describes the Emacspeak audio desktop and gives tips and
tricks for making use of many of Emacs' powerful features.

   The desktop is the work area where you organize the tools of your
trade and the information objects relevant to your current activities.
In the conventional world of visual GUI-based computing, these tools
and information objects manifest themselves as a collection of icons
organized in a two-dimensional work-area -this organization is designed
to place frequently used objects within easy reach.

   Notice that organizing one's work area in terms of visual icons
arranged in a two-dimensional area where such an organization is
optimized for the available "conversational gestures" of pointing and
clicking is an artifact of visual interaction.

   In the spirit of a truly speech-enabled application, Emacspeak does
not simply provide you spoken access to a particular presentation of
your work environment that was initially designed with the "sign
language" of visual interaction in mind. Instead, Emacspeak enables you
to work with documents and other information objects in a manner that
is optimized to aural, eyes-free interaction.  A necessary consequence
of this setup is that users accustomed to the purely visual
manifestation of today's electronic desktop do not immediately perceive
the Emacspeak environment as an electronic desktop.  This section of the
manual hopes to introduce you to a work-style that encourages a
different perspective on how one interacts with the computer in
performing day-to-day computing tasks.

   The end result in my case has been a marked increase in personal
productivity.

6.1 Objects Making Up The Emacspeak Desktop
===========================================

A "buffer" is the basic building block of the Emacs and hence the
Emacspeak desktop.  Any information presented by Emacs is placed in a
"buffer".  For example, when perusing this manual within Emacs, the
"file" containing the documentation is presented in a "buffer".  All
information objects such as WWW pages, email messages, output from user
interaction with command-line shells etc., are presented by Emacs in
individual "buffers".

   Buffers provide a base level of user interaction; Emacs derives its
power by allowing applications to specialize buffers to enable specific
types of user-interaction that is optimized for a specific class of
information.


File: emacspeak.info,  Node: Object Oriented Desktop,  Next: Context-Sensitive Interaction,  Prev: Desktop Objects,  Up: Audio Desktop

6.2 An Object-Oriented Desktop
==============================

The basic "buffer object" can be specialized by Emacs applications to
provide optimal interaction.  This kind of specialization makes the
Emacs environment an object-oriented environment; thus, the basic
conversational gesture of "move to the next statement" can be assigned
behavior that is appropriate to the content that the user is currently
navigating.  As an example of such specialization, Emacs provides
"specialized  modes" for working with English text, programming
languages, markup source e.g. HTML or LaTeX documents and so on.


File: emacspeak.info,  Node: Context-Sensitive Interaction,  Prev: Object Oriented Desktop,  Up: Audio Desktop

6.3 Emacspeak Specializes Aural Interaction
===========================================

The content-specific user interaction described above is a very
powerful feature of Emacs, and this is where Emacspeak derives its
power.  Traditionally, the ability to create buffers specialized for
working with specific content-types has been used by the Emacs
community to develop versatile programming environments, messaging
applications such as mail and news readers, and authoring environments.
The clean design present in all of these Emacs extensions in terms of
separating application functionality from the user-interface, combined
with the availability of the entire source code making up these
packages under the open-source model has laid the ground-work for
developing Emacspeak as a versatile aural counterpart to the product of
years of software engineering that has been invested by the Emacs
community.  In short, Emacspeak would not exist in its present shape or
form without this prior effort.

6.3.1 Audio Formatted Output
----------------------------

Emacspeak takes advantage of the content-specific knowledge available
within specialized buffers to produce "audio formatted" output designed
to optimize user interaction.  A basic consequence of the above is
"voice locking" in specialized modes; a more interesting consequence is
the implementation of Aural Cascading Style Sheets (ACSS) in
conjunction with the Emacs W3 browser.

6.3.2 Structured Navigation:
----------------------------

Emacspeak  also exploits content-specific knowledge to provide
structured navigation of different types of electronic content. In many
cases, such structured navigation is an extension of what Emacs
provides by default; in other cases, Emacspeak implements the necessary
extensions to provide the level of structural navigation needed to work
efficiently in an eyes-free environment.

   Notable among such structured navigation is Emacs' powerful outline
feature. Notice for example, that the Emacspeak FAQ (reached via command
`emacspeak-view-emacspeak-faq' bound to `C-e F') takes advantage of
Emacs' outline mode to allow you to easily move through the various
sections.  An example of content-sensitive navigation is provided by
the imenu package which dynamically creates a "table of contents" based
on the content that is being displayed in a given buffer.

6.3.3 Navigating The Desktop
----------------------------

In addition to navigating individual information objects, the Emacspeak
environment provides speech-enabled navigation of the various buffers
that are currently open on the Emacspeak desktop via Emacs' built-in
list-buffers feature.  Emacs' dired  -directory editor- for browsing
the file system, along with the new speedbar package that combines
features from dired and imenu round off the suite of navigational tools.

6.3.4 Everything Is Searchable:
-------------------------------

Emacs derives one final advantage from using buffers as the basic
building block for the entire desktop.  Every Emacs buffer is searchable
via a uniform and powerful search interface.  Emacs' incremental search
works efficiently and consistently to enable you locate "objects" of
interest either within a given document or to locate a given object from
among the various objects that are currently open on the Emacspeak
desktop.  This is very powerful -where a GUI user is typically limited
to quickly locating an object from a relatively small collection -the
size of the collection being a direct function of available display
real-estate- the Emacspeak user can typically work with a far larger
collection of objects.  This is well-suited to the eyes-free
environment, where display real-estate has no meaning; so bringing up a
list of currently open buffers and performing an incremental search to
locate a specific buffer is just as efficient independent of whether you
have a few dozen or a few hundred buffers open.

   To illustrate the above, my typical working Emacs session lasts
between two and three weeks- over that time I typically accumulate
several hundred open buffers holding a large variety of content ranging
from program source code to email messages and WWW pages.

   Ubiquitous search in the eyes-free environment is critical- as a
comparison, when using a conventional, purely visual WWW browser, users
have no means of easily "searching" for say the "submit" button on a WWW
page.  This inability is a minor annoyance in visual interaction, and
the typical mouse-enabled user never uses the find dialog to find a
submit button- it is simply more efficient to point at the submit
button given the eye's ability to quickly scan the two-dimensional
display.  This luxury is absent in an eyes-free environment; as a
consequence, blind users confronted by the combination of a visual
interface and screen-reader are typically limited to either tabbing
through all the controls on a WWW page, or using the sub-optimal find
dialog.

7 Voice Lock
************

  1. Emacspeak defines a number of voice overlays such as
     `voice-bolden', and `voice-lighten' that can be applied to a given
     voice to change what it sounds like.

  2. Voice overlays are defined in terms of Aural CSS (ACSS
     (http://www.w3.org/tr/css2/aural.html)) to keep them independent
     of a specific TTS engine.

  3. For each such overlay there is a corresponding
     `<overlay-name>-settings' variable that can be customized via
     custom.

  4. The numbers in `voice-bolden-settings as an example':

Setting                              Value
family                               nil
average-pitch                        1
pitch-range                          6
stress                               6
richness                             nil
punctuation                          nil
   Unset values (`nil') show up as "unspecified" in the customize
interface.

  1. Do not directly customize `voice-bolden' and friends, instead
     customize the corresponding `voice-bolden-settings', since that
     ensures that all voices that are defined in terms of
     `voice-bolden' get correctly updated.

  2. Discovering what to customize:

   Command `emacspeak-show-personality-at-point' (bound by default to
C-e M-v) will show you the value of properties personality and face at
point. A recent update I implemented last weekend makes this more
useful, so make sure you do a CVS update; earlier this command used to
display the ACSS setting -- now it displays the abstract name.
Describe-variable on these names should tell you what to customize; so
as an example:

   Put point on a comment line, and hit `C-e M-v': you will hear

     Personality emacspeak-voice-lock-comment-personality
     Face font-lock-comment-delimiter-face

   Describe-variable of `emacspeak-voice-lock-comment-personality'
gives:

     emacspeak-voice-lock-comment-personality's value is acss-p0-s0-all

     Documentation:
     Personality used for font-lock-comment-face
     This personality uses  voice-monotone whose  effect can be changed globally by customizing voice-monotone-settings.

7.1 How It All Works
====================

Here is a brief explanation of the connection between `voice-bolden'
and its associated `voice-bolden-settings'.

  1. Voice  settings are initially in `voice-bolden-settings' which is
     a list of numbers.

  2. That list of numbers needs to be translated to appropriate
     device-specific codes to send to the TTS engine.

  3. You do not want to do this translation _each_ time you speak
     something.

  4. So when `voice-bolden' is defined, the definition happens in two
     steps:

   * The list of settings is stored away in `voice-bolden-settings',

   * A corresponding voice-name is generated --
     `acss-a<n>-p<n>-r<n>-s<n>' and the corresponding control codes to
     send to the device are stored away in a hash-table keyed by the
     above symbol.

   * Finally, `voice-bolden' is assigned the above symbol.

* Menu:

* What this gives.::


File: emacspeak.info,  Node: What this gives.,  Prev: How It All Works.,  Up: Voice Lock

7.2 What this gives is
======================

  1. The ability to customize the voice via custom by editting the list
     of numbers in `voice-bolden-settings'

  2. When that list is editted, `voice-bolden' is arranged to be
     updated automatically.

   The following additional commands from module *Note
emacspeak-wizards::, are  useful when designing aural styles.
  1. emacspeak-wizards-generate-voice-sampler

     Generate a buffer containing text that demonstrates the effect of
     various aural settings.

  2. emacspeak-wizards-voice-sampler

     Applied specified aural style to text in current region.

8 Using Online Help With Emacspeak.
***********************************

Emacs provides an extensive online help system for helping you learn
about various aspects of using Emacs. Emacspeak provides online help for
its various extensions using this same help system.  This chapter
explains how to use the online help facilities in order to empower you
in discovering powerful and versatile working techniques that will make
you more and more productive in your day to day computing.

   The online help options are accessed via the `C-h' prefix key, which
must be followed by an additional letter or control character to
designate the kind of help desired.   For example, `C-h t'
`help-with-tutorial' visits the Emacs tutorial in a new buffer; `C-h i'
`info' enters the Info documentation system, from which you can read
Texinfo manuals that have been installed on your system, including the
Emacs and Emacspeak documentation; and `C-h k' `describe-key' provides
a description of the Emacs function which is bound to the next key that
you type.  For learning about the various  options  that are available
via the `C-h' mechanism described above, view the online help for
command `help-for-help' bound to `C-h C-h' --using what has been
described so far, you would achieve this by pressing `C-h k' followed
by `C-h C-h'.

   Emacspeak users should note that online help is typically displayed
in a separate Emacs window. Where it makes sense to do so, Emacspeak
will automatically speak the displayed help.  Once you've asked for
help, you can have the displayed documentation as many times as you
wish using Emacspeak command `emacspeak-speak-help' bound to `C-e h'.
If you want to move through the displayed help a line at a time, switch
to the buffer where the help is displayed -the buffer is called
`*Help*'.

   Often, in adding an auditory interface to an Emacs extension, such
as a web browser or mail reader, Emacspeak defines additional commands
and key bindings which enhance the functionality of the spoken feedback
provided by the application. This manual does not purport to document
all such commands. It is important, therefore, when learning to use the
various Emacs extensions which comprise the `audio desktop' (*note
Audio Desktop::) that you take advantage of online help to obtain
details of any context-specific features provided by Emacspeak.  The
following two commands are of particular importance in this regard:

   * `C-h m' `describe-mode' explains which major and minor modes are
     currently in effect, and lists the commands and key bindings
     associated with them.

   * `C-h b' `describe-bindings' lists all of the key bindings which are
     currently defined.

   The importance of these help functions can be illustrated by the
Emacs/W3 web browser. When point is positioned inside a table, certain
key bindings are established with which you can access Emacspeak
commands that make it possible to read the rows and columns of the
table and explore its structure efficiently. To get a description of
these key bindings, you can use W3 to visit the sample HTML file
supplied as part of the Emacspeak distribution, and, after having moved
point onto the first row of the table, issue the command `C-h m'
`describe-mode' to create a help buffer containing an explanation of
the features offered by W3 mode.

   Emacspeak supplements the online help facilities available within
Emacs by defining several commands of its own, as follows:

   * `C-h c-e' `describe-emacspeak' presents a list of standard
     Emacspeak commands.

   * `C-e F' `emacspeak-view-emacspeak-faq' opens a new buffer
     containing the Emacspeak FAQ, a list of frequently asked questions
     about Emacspeak together with their answers.

   * `C-e C-h' `emacspeak-learn-mode' enters a mode in which the
     function of every key that you type is spoken; this mode can be
     terminated with the `C-g' `keyboard-quit' command.

   * `M-x emacspeak-generate-documentation' prompts for the name of a
     file in which it saves an automatically generated summary of all
     Emacspeak commands.

Emacs - The extensible, self-documenting editor, derives its
functionality from its powerful extension mechanism. This extension
mechanism is used to implement many user-level applications such as mail
readers, WWW browsers, software development environments and so on.
This chapter gives directions on how to locate the right Emacs package
for addressing specific tasks.  The chapter is organized into logical
sections that each pertain to a specific class of tasks; in individual
subsections within a section give a brief overview of particular Emacs
packages that have been speech-enabled.

9.1 Document Authoring
======================

The Emacspeak environment provides a rich collection of structured
document authoring tools.  These are well-suited for working in an
eyes-free environment -you clearly do not want to use a What You See Is
What You Get (WYSIWYG) authoring tool if you cannot see what you're
getting.  Structure-based authoring tools allow you to focus on the act
of content creation, leaving the minutiae of visual layout to the
computer.

9.1.1 Creating Well-formatted Documents
---------------------------------------

Before authoring a document, decide its primary audience if the
document contains relatively simple content e.g., no mathematical
equations etc.  and is primarily targeted at the WWW,  you are probably
better off using HTML.  You can create well-structured HTML documents
with the help of package `html-helper-mode' available from
`ftp://ftp.reed.edu/pub/src/html-helper-mode.tar.gz' -- note this is
now mostly obsoleted by James Clarke's excellent `nxml-mode' for
editting  XML documents.

   Package `html-helper-mode' is speech-enabled by Emacspeak to provide
auditory icons, structured navigation and outlines, as well as voice
locking for audio formatted feedback as you work.

   If the document being authored is more complex, you are usually
better off creating it in LaTeX.  Note that LaTeX documents can be
converted to HTML either via package  package `tex4ht' - available on
the WWW.

   The TeX family of typesetting languages  is suitable for producing
well-formatted documents in an eyes-free environment.  Unlike WYSIWYG
environments, the author  of a TeX or LaTeX document works with the
content of the document, leaving it to the formatting system (TeX) to
format the document for good visual presentation.

   The auctex package is an Emacs extension that facilitates authoring
and maintaining structured documents in TeX and LaTeX.  Package
`bibtex' facilitates maintenance and use of `bibtex' bibliography
databases.  The Texinfo package allows creation of software
documentation that is suitable for both printing as well as online
viewing as hypertext.  Emacspeak speech-enables packages `auctex',
`bibtex' and `texinfo' to provide convenient spoken feedback as you
create and compile documents. For details on using these packages, see
their accompanying online info documentation.

   The most recent version of package `auctex' is always available by
ftp at `ftp://ftp.iesd.auc.dk/pub/emacs-lisp/auctex.tar.gz'.  Packages
`bibtex' and  `texinfo' are part of the standard Emacs distribution.

   As the document preparation system of choice, Emacspeak supports a
fluent speech-enabled interface to editing and formatting LaTeX
documents.  This interface is provided by speech-enabling  _auctex_
mode.

   Mode _auctex_ provides efficient keyboard shortcuts for inserting
and maintaining LaTeX markup as a document is being authored.  All of
these editing commands provide succinct auditory feedback when used
with Emacspeak.  The syntax coloring provided by this mode is extended
to provide _   voice locking_ -- consequently, Emacspeak uses different
voices to speak the embedded markup to set it apart from the content.

   Mode _auctex_ can be used to create empty document templates and to
insert document content at the appropriate places in the template.  The
mode also enables structured navigation of the document as it is being
edited.  Emacspeak speech-enables these template creation and
structured navigation commands to produce auditory icons and succinct
spoken feedback.  For example, while editing, the user can quickly
browse through the sections of the document and have each section title
spoken.  Document elements such as paragraphs and bulleted lists can be
manipulated as logical units.  These features are especially relevant
in an eyes-free environment where the user needs to select logical
parts of the document without having to point at portions of a visual
display.

   Finally, Emacs supports creating and maintaining SGML and XML
documents.  Emacs comes with a fairly simple `sgml-mode' -in addition,
package `psgml' provides sophisticated parsing and validation
facilities for working with SGML and XML documents.  Package `psgml'
can be downloaded from
`http://w4.lns.cornell.edu/public/COMP/info/psgml/psgml_toc.html'.


File: emacspeak.info,  Node: Search replace and spell check,  Prev: Creating Well-formatted Documents,  Up: Document Authoring

9.1.2 Searching, Replacing, And Spell Checking
----------------------------------------------

Incremental search, a process by which the system prompts the user for a
search string and moves the selection to the next available match while
allowing the user to add more characters to the search string, is the
search technique of choice among most Emacs users.  As the system
successively finds each match and provides the user the option of
continuing the search.  Incremental search is a more complex instance of
traditional search interaction because in addition to either stopping or
continuing the search, the user can modify the current search in a
number of ways including specifying a longer (or shorter) search string.

   All of the user commands available during incremental search are
documented in the online Emacs info manual.  These are speech-enabled by
Emacspeak to provide spoken prompts as the dialogue begins; auditory
icons indicate a search hit or search miss as the search progresses.
Along with auditory icons _search-hit_ and _search-miss_ the user also
hears the current line spoken, and in the case of a search hit, the
matching text is _aurally_ highlighted by using the standard audio
formatting technique of changing voice characteristic.  This feedback
proves extremely effective when the search pattern appears several
times on a single line; the user is unambiguously cued to the current
match.

   Search and replace actions are an extension to the basic
conversational gestures of  a search dialogue.  In addition to
specifying a search string, the user also specifies a replacement
string.  On the Emacspeak desktop, this functionality is provided by
command _query-replace_.  The speech-enabled version of this
interaction prompts the user for the search and replacement texts.  The
auditory feedback during the interactive search and replacement process
parallels that described in the case of incremental search.  Audio
formatting to indicate the occurrence that is about to be replaced
proves an effective means of avoiding erroneous modifications to the
text being edited.  As an example, consider using command _
query-replace_ to locate and replace the second occurrence of   foo
with bar in the text

   `Do not change this fool, but change this food.'

   When the search matches the first occurrence of foo  in word _fool_,
the aural highlighting helps the user in  answering "no" in response to
question "should this occurrence be  replaced".  In addition to
allowing the user to supply a  simple "yes or no" answer for each
match, command _    query-replace_ also allows the user to specify a
number of other  valid answers as described  in the online Emacs
documentation.

Spell Checking
..............

A more complex instance of conversational gesture "search and replace"
is exhibited by standard spell checking dialogues.  Spell checking
differs from the search and replace dialogue described above in that
the search and replacement text is guessed by the system based on an
available dictionary.  Words that are not found in the dictionary are
flagged as potential spelling errors, and the system offers an
interactive search and replace dialogue for each of these possible
errors.  During this dialogue, the system successively selects each
occurrence of the possibly erroneous word and offers a set of possible
replacements.  Unlike in the case of simple search and replace, more
than one possible replacement string is offered, since a potential
spelling error can be corrected by more than one word appearing in the
dictionary.

   In the visual interface, such spell checking dialogues are realized
by displaying the available choices in a pop-up window and allowing the
user to pick a correction Once a correction is selected, the user is
offered the choice of interactively  replacing the erroneous word with
the correction.

   The spell checking interface on the Emacspeak desktop is
speech-enabled to provide fluent auditory feedback.  The visual
interface parallels that described above and is provided by package
`ispell' which is part of the standard Emacs distribution.  Emacspeak
provides a spoken prompt that is composed of the line containing the
possibly erroneous word (which is aurally highlighted to set it apart
from the rest of the text on that line) and the available corrections.
Each correction is prefixed with a number that the user can use to
select it.  Once a correction is selected, the interaction continues
with the query and replace interaction described earlier.  The speech
interface to the spell checker is as fluent as the visual interface.
Notice that Emacspeak users do not need to concern themselves with the
details of the visual display such as "the corrections are displayed in
a window at the top of the screen".

   In addition to the standard spell checker described above, newer
versions of Emacs include an "on-the-fly" spell checker that flags
erroneous words as they are typed.  Emacspeak speech-enables package
`flyspell' so that such erroneous words are aurally highlighted.

9.2 Structured Editing And Templates
====================================

Editing documents based on the inherent structure present in the
electronic encoding can be very efficient when using spoken
interaction.  We described mode _ auctex_ -- a specialized interface to
authoring LaTeX documents as a special instance of such structured
editing in *note Document Authoring::.

   The Emacspeak desktop allows the user to efficiently author and
maintain an electronic document based either on the structure present
in the markup (as in the case of mode auctex) or on special outlining
constructs that allow the user to impose a desired logical structure on
the document.  This section describes the effect of speech-enabling
such editing tools and points out the advantages in using these in a
speech oriented interface.

   Template-based authoring -- a technique that allows the user to
create a document by inserting contents into appropriate positions in a
predefined template-- goes hand in hand with such structured editing.
Finally, structured editing can vastly simplify the creation and
maintenance of structured data, for example, the data present in a UNIX
password file.  Such data files are in fact nothing more than a
collection of database records, where each record (or line) consists of
a set of fields delimited by a special character.  Maintaining such
files without exploiting the underlying structure often tends to be
error prone.  We describe editing modes that can exploit such record
structure to provide a fluent editing interface.  Finally, we outline a
speech-enabled interface to a spreadsheet application as a complex
instance of such structured data editing.

* Maintaining Structured Data::   Structured Data.


File: emacspeak.info,  Node: Outline Editing,  Next: Template-based Authoring,  Up: Structured Editing

9.2.1 Outline Editing
---------------------

All of the various outline editing interfaces on the Emacs desktop
allow the user to _ hide_ or _ show_ the contents at the different
levels of a possibly nested tree structure.     Components of this tree
structure can be manipulated as a unit, e.g., entire subtrees can be
deleted or copied.  Outline editing thus provides an efficient means of
obtaining quick overviews of a document.

   The visual interface displays such hidden content as a series of
ellipses following the visible outline heading.  Emacspeak produces
auditory icon _ ellipses_ when speaking such outline headings.

   The basic _ outline mode_ allows the user to specify the syntax and
level of outline header lines as a regular expression.  This simple
technique can be used to advantage in the structured navigation of
large electronic texts such as those available on the Internet from
online book projects such as project Gutenberg and the Internet
Wiretap.  For example, when this feature is activated while reading the
electronic text of a Shakespearean play, the different acts can be
recognized as separate nodes in the logical structure of the document.
The user can then hide the document body with a single keystroke,
navigate the outline headings to find a particular act, and have that
portion rendered either visually or aurally.  Hiding an outline level
produces auditory icon _ close-object_; exposing a hidden level
produces auditory icon _ open-object_.  For details on using mode
`outline', see the relevant section of the online Emacs info manual.

   The basic outline facility described above is applicable to all
content being edited or browsed on the Emacspeak desktop.  In addition,
Emacspeak has  other specialized outline editing modes such as  _
folding mode_ that provide extended outlining facilities.  In mode _
folding_, the user can create (possibly nested) _ folds_ -- logical
containers of content that are delimited by a special _ fold mark_.
The fold mark is typically a text string that is chosen based on the
type of content that is being manipulated.  Thus, when _ folding_ a
C~program source file, fold marks are created from C~comments.  The
user can _ open_ or _ close_ any or all folds in a document, and these
actions are accompanied by auditory icons _ open-object_ and _
close-object_.  By entering a fold, all editing actions are restricted
to the contents of that fold; this proves a simple yet convenient way
of constraining editing actions such as search and replace to specific
portions of large documents.  Folds can be manipulated as a unit and
can be deleted, copied or moved.

   Mode _ folding_ proves especially effective in maintaining large
software modules.  The technique can be used to advantage by creating
folds for different sections in a module and by further placing each
function appearing in a particular % section in a fold of its own.
Complex functions can themselves be folded into sections where each
section reflects a different stage in the algorithm implemented by that
function.  Thus, the technique of folding can be used as an effective
aid in _ literate_ programming.  I typically write software modules by
first creating an outline structure using folds that reflect the
various components of that module. Next, I populate each fold with the
function signatures and documentation for the functions in each
section.  When I am satisfied with the overall architecture of the
module, I fill in the function skeletons with actual program code.
This technique is used extensively in maintaining  the  Emacspeak code
base.

9.2.2 Template-based Authoring
------------------------------

Emacspeak supports two powerful template-based authoring subsystems that
enable the user to quickly create and fill in templates.  _ Dmacro_
(short for "dynamic macros") allows the user to define and invoke
template-based macros that are specialized for creating different types
of content.  For example, when programming in C, the user can invoke
dynamic macros that insert skeletons of standard C constructs with a few
keystrokes.  This form of editing has numerous advantages in creating
consistently structured code when developing large software modules.
Emacspeak speech-enables mode _ dmacro_ to provide succinct spoken
feedback as templates are created and filled.  The user invokes _
dmacro_ via command _ insert dmacro_, which is typically bound to a
single key.  This results in a dialogue where the user is prompted to
pick one of the dynamic macros available in the current context.  If the
users choice can be uniquely completed, that completion is spoken;
otherwise, the list of possible completions based on the available
partial input is spoken, accompanied by auditory icon _ help_.

   An alternative template-editing facility is provided by mode  _
tempo_ This mode is designed to  be used in creating template-based
editing tools for specific markup languages; a good example is mode _
html-helper_, a  mode for creating and updating HTML documents for
publishing on the WWW (see *note Document Authoring::).

9.2.3 Maintaining Structured Data
---------------------------------

Consider the following entry from file ` /etc/passwd' on my laptop.

   `aster:KoUxwQ2:501:100:Aster Labrador:/home/aster:/bin/bash'

   File ` /etc/passwd' is a simple instance of a text file that stores
structured data records as a series of fields delimited by a special
character. Each item in the file acquires _   meaning_ from the _
position_  in which it  occurs   for example, the fifth field contains
the  user name, Aster Labrador.  More generally, structured data where
each field in a record has _   meaning_ is found throughout the desktop
in applications ranging from entries in a rolodex to rows in a
spreadsheet.

   Typically, users do not directly edit the stored representation of
the data. Instead, application front-ends provide a more human-centric
(and hopefully less error prone) user interface for modifying and
maintaining the data. Thus, spreadsheet applications present the data
as a two dimensional table that is automatically updated to reflect
changes in the underlying data. The two dimensional table is perhaps
the most commonly found visual front-end to structured data tables with
row and column headers prove a succinct way of implicitly displaying
the _ meaning_ along with the _value_ of the fields making up each data
record.

primary web browsers in use under emacspeak and ways they might be used
more efficiently.

9.4.1 Intro
-----------

Web browsing in emacspeak can be made as simple or as complicated as
you wish to make it.  On the one hand, all that need be done is to open
a web browser and fetch a particular url.  This works fine in many
cases with exceptions being things like html tables.  On the other
hand, if you spend a little time learning a particular browser and its
functionality, web browsing can be made more efficient and the web more
navigable.

   This document is intended to be an introduction to the 2 primary
browsers that run under emacs: emacs/w3 and emacs-w3m.  I also intend
to introduce a couple of add-on packages intended to make life easier
and to address specific shortcomings.

   The primary reason for this documentation is the fact that a lot of
the documentation of the various functions tells exactly what it does,
but not why or in what circumstance one might use it.  Hopefully I can
remedy that here.

Who this document is intended for
=================================

While this document is geared toward emacspeak users, it might be
helpful for other users as well.  I have tried to note where functions
are specific to emacspeak.

Assumptions
===========

This document assumes emacs is installed.  If reading the section on a
particular browser and trying out the associated functions, it, of
course, assumes that the browser is installed and working. For features
specific to emacspeak, a working install of emacspeak is necessary.  It
is far beyond the scope of this document to help with the installation
of these programs.

   For help with installing any of the above bits of software, the
following mailing lists and / or newsgroups are available:

   * emacs - `gnu.emacs.help'

   * emacs-w3m - see `http://emacs-w3m.namazu.org'

   * emacs/w3 - the mailing list for w3 is pretty dead.  Sorry.  The
     documentation is, however, not terrible.

   * emacspeak - see `http://emacspeak.sf.net'

   It is highly suggested that the mailing list archives, google, and
the relevant documentation be consulted before posting messages to any
mailing list.  Nothing is more irritating than answering the same
questions over and over.  Those of you with kids know what I am talking
about.

   It is also assumed that the reader is comfortable with using emacs
itself.  Understanding the convention for communicating keystrokes to
run commands, navigating documents, and the like are not covered.


File: emacspeak.info,  Node: emacs-w3m,  Next: emacs/w3,  Prev: Intro,  Up: Web Browsing

9.4.2 emacs-w3m
---------------

emacs-w3m is a front-end, written in emacs lisp, to the text-based web
browser w3m.  It supports tables, images, and all major web protocols.
It is also fully supported in emacspeak.

emacs-w3m advantages
====================

The main advantage of emacs-w3m is speed.  The rendering of web pages
is done with the external program w3m.  which is written in c, so it is
fast.  It also seems not to choke on some web pages like the
alternative, emacs/w3.

   Another big advantage to emacs-w3m is that it is under active
development.  Problems seem to be fixed soon after they come to the
attention of the developers and are available very quickly as long as
you are willing to use the cvs version.

   For those who have limited sight as opposed to no sight at all,
emacs-w3m displays all graphics within its own buffer.  This might be a
misconfiguration on my part, but there are some images that open in an
external window when opened from emacs/w3.

   I can also say that I cannot remember a page that wouldn't render in
emacs-w3m.  This is not something I can say about emacs/w3.

emacs-w3m disadvantages
=======================

Taken by itself, the disadvantages of using w3m are few.  Long periods
between releases can be seen by some to be a disadvantage although the
alternative browser's time between releases is now several years, I
believe.

   With hardware or software that support multiple voices, such as IBM's
Via Voice, one can allow differences in speech to indicate differences
in document text.  For example, headings can be spoken in a voice with
a lower pitch, links in a higher voice.  The voices in emacs-w3m are
much more limited than those in emacs/w3 and not all textual attributes
can be indicated.  As of the writing of this document, `pre' tags and
the like cannot be indicated.  It has been within the last few months
that italic text support has been added.

   Another disadvantage is the fact that the rendering in emacs-w3m is
done by the external process, w3m.  Since w3m is written in C, it is
not as easily customizable from within the community of emacs users.
Code written in emacs lisp can be substituted for code in a running
emacs instance, something that is not possible in C.

   A further disadvantage is the lack of table navigation, i.e. the
ability to move from cell to cell in a table to more easily understand
the information presented.  Linearizing the table is available but
sometimes it is difficult to keep the meanings of the columns in your
head to discern the meaning.  Maybe it is just me.

   A disadvantage shared between the browsers is the lack of support for
javascript.  Many sites use javascript for links to the next page, such
as Reuters web site.  This can sometimes be worked around using the
google transcoder.  See *Note below: w3m-transcode, for more
information.

emacs-w3m native functions
==========================

This part of the document is not meant to replace the `describe-mode'
information available via the `C-h m' keystroke or the emacs-w3m info
manual.  This is by no means an exhaustive list of available commands.

   emacs-w3m has considerable functionality and many features that make
browsing more efficient and convenient.  Below are many of the
functions that are native to emacs-w3m.

   `Cap S' will query for a search term.  By default, the search engine
used is google.  This can be changed with a prefix command.  To see the
available engines, after hitting `C-u Cap S', when it asks for the
engine hit <TAB> to get a list of available completions.  Tab
completion of partial words works here as well.  For example, hitting
"y" and then <TAB> will complete to the word "yahoo".

   Form navigation can be achieved with the right and left brackets.
This is useful for times where you want to go to the input field on a
web page without having to tab through the links.  Google is a good
example of where this would be useful.  The right bracket moves point
to the next form, and the left bracket moves to the previous, wrapping
around at the ends of the buffer.

   While in a form, using `C-c C-c' will submit the form with no need to
tab around looking for the "Submit" button.

emacspeak specific functions for emacs-w3m
==========================================

Many extensions have been written by the emacspeak community to expand
emacs-w3m and make it more accessible.  Below are those extensions.

   While being a variable and not a function, the variable
`emacspeak-w3m-speak-titles-on-switch' makes emacs-w3m more friendly.
It tells emacspeak to speak the document title when switching between
emacs-w3m buffers.  The default, `nil', will speak the mode line.  This
is the same behavior seen in all other buffers.  This speaking of the
document title is more descriptive than just hearing `*w3m*<4>'.  This
variable can be customized in the usual ways, either in your `.emacs'
file or via the `Customize' interface.  If you do set this variable,
reading the mode line can still be achieved with `C-e m'.

   The `j' command will jump to the first occurance of the title in the
document.  Each time you use this command in succession, it will jump
to the next occurance of the title.  This is very convenient for web
pages that have the title show up in multiple places in the document.
The web site for The Register is a good example of this.

   The `l' command uses the default media player to play the media
stream at point.  I believe this is set to `emacspeak-m-player' by
default.  While beyond the scope of this document to describe the
installation of mplayer, I would highly advise using this media player.
With the correct codecs installed, mplayer will play everything you
will find, I believe, with one convenient player that does not require
a GUI.

   `C-t' will run the current page through the google transcoder.  The
transcoder is very useful to the users of screen readers as it takes
care of formatting issues like tables.  While not usually a problem,
There is a function to linearize tables in emacs-w3m, but it is not
always successful.  You can reverse this command by giving a prefix
argument.

   `M-t' runs the url under point through the transcoder.  This command
can be reversed by giving a prefix argument.

   Extensions have been written to take advantage of much of the google
functionality.  The following describes how to access many of these
extensions.

   `C-c C-g' will search the current web site with google.

   `C-c C-x' will extract the current page from the google cache.  A
prefix argument will extract the url under point from the cache.  This
is useful if, for instance, a site is down for one reason or another and
you absolutely must have the information.

   `C-c C-l' will find pages similar to the current page.  This is just
like the "similar" link at the end of a google search result.

   `C-c C-r' will browse the rss link under point.  One reason this
might be useful is to first try out the rss feed before you configure
your rss reader to subscribe to the feed.  For a easy to use rss reader,
see the section below on *Note `emacspeak-rss': rss.

   The letter `x' is the prefix key for the xsl transforms.  xslt is
some powerful ju-ju.  It takes a web page and does all kinds of cool
things with it.  These things are listed below.

   The command `x a' will apply an xsl transformation to the current
page.  one particularly useful transform is to linearize tables.  This
takes the tables and formats them linearly down the page as if they
were paragraphs instead of table cells.  This command can be more
easily applied with the `x l' command.

   If you want to always have tables linearized, use the `x a' command
and type `linearize <TAB>' and then the `x o' to toggle xsl on.  This
will linearize the tables in every subsequently visited page for this
session.  While it seems possible to make this happen automatically in
emacs/w3, I do not believe this is currently possible in emacs-w3m.  A
noticeable increase in speed can be seen in emacs/w3 by turning xslt on
and using `sort-tables' or `linearize-tables'.  This eliminates the
need for the browser to render nested tables.  Since speed is not such
an issue with emacs-w3m, I don't bother turning on xslt for the session.

   The `x b' command will add a "submit" button to forms that do not
have one such as the one on the emacswiki web site .  Submitting forms
can be more easily achieved with `C-c C-c'.

   If on a google search page, the `x h' command will give you only the
search hits.  An easier way of getting the same results is to use the
`url-template' "Google Hits" which returns the same results.  Another
advantage of using the `url-template' is that it can be done from
anywhere, not just in an emacs-w3m buffer.  *Note
emacspeak-url-template: emacspeak url template, for more information.

   The `x t' command sorts the tables.  It takes the nested tables and
unnests them.  While sometimes useful, this is not nearly as useful as
the same function in emacs/w3.  While doing the same thing, emacs/w3
has the capability of allowing the user to navigate the tables cell by
cell.

emacs-w3m tips and tricks
=========================

One issue that might need work is that, by default, when tabbing over
links in emacs-w3m the url of the link is spoken.  There are several
ways to deal with this.

   One solution, actually two but they accomplish the same result, is to
include the following code in the `~/.emacs-w3m' file:

     (remove-hook 'w3m-after-cursor-move-hook
          #'w3m-print-this-url)

Or, this code in the .emacs file

     (add-hook 'w3m-after-cursor-move-hook
     	  (lambda ()
     	    (emacspeak-speak-messages nil)))

   Both of these solutions, as far as the user can see, seem to be
equivalent.  They differ only in where they are placed.

   The other solution is to leave things as they are.  Some users
mention that they find it helpful to have the url spoken and, if they
want the text of the link spoken they use `C-e l'.  As with everything
else in emacs, it is completely up to you to decide what is best.

9.4.3 emacs/w3
--------------

emacs/w3 is a web browser written completely in emacs lisp.  It has
some really nice features applicable to the emacspeak community such as
the ability to navigate tables and support for the w3c's aural
cascading stylesheets.

emacs/w3 advantages
===================

As mentioned above, the ability to navigate tables is a super help.
emacs/w3 also has support for cascading stylesheets.  This allows
incredible control of voices used for what would normally be visual
attributes of the text such as bold, italics, preformatted text and the
like.

   Another advantage of emacs/w3 is that it is written completely in
emacs lisp.  With some effort, emacs/w3 is very customizable and quite
extendable.

emacs/w3 disadvantages
======================

Rendering can be slow.  Sometimes it can be painfully, excruciatingly
slow.  That might be a slight exaggeration, but slow it is.  This is
because it is written in lisp... something I mentioned just above as a
strength.  It is a trade-off, but one that some see as worth it.  There
are, however,  some things that can be done to speed up the browsing
process.  See *Note `emacspeak-w3-xsl-transform': xsl-transform, for
more information.

   Another disadvantage is that emacs/w3 chokes on some pages.
Sometimes it gives error messages and doesn't display anything.
Sometimes it does this to some people and doesn't do it to others as we
saw on the emacspeak mailing list a short time ago.  Sometimes it gives
error messages and renders the page anyway.

   As mentioned in the emacs-w3m section, this browser does not support
javascript, which is a problem, usually for links on some sites.  One
way this problem can be sometimes worked around is to transcode the
link under point via google.  See *Note w3 transcode: w3 transcode, for
more information.

   One other major annoyance of emacs/w3 is that sometimes it simply
stops doing anything while rendering a page.  There is a way I have
found to get around this.  I hit `C-g'.  I usually wait five to ten
seconds and then simply quit, using `C-g'.  Not always, but usually,
the page has already completed downloading and is being rendered and it
therefore is not a problem.

   emacs/w3 also has no bookmark functionality.  This can be remedied in
several ways.  One simple way, mentioned below, is to use the emacs
package bmk-mgr.  Another way is to use org mode with remember which is
the method used by Dr. Raman, the author of emacspeak.  See *Note
bmk-mgr: bmk-mgr, later in this manual, for more information.

   History back and next in the browser also seem to be broken but this
is not generally a problem for me as I never look back.

emacs/w3 native functions
=========================

Many functions for efficient navigation of the internet are native to
emacs/w3.  Some of the most useful functions are listed below

   Unlike emacs-w3m, the information presented by `describe-mode' is
very complete, but a little terse.  All the function names are listed
and asking for help on particular functions works well.  That being
said, use this list to augment, not replace, the built-in help that is
available in emacs.

   `C-f' will open a new buffer containing the cell point is in.  In
most instances, this works very well.  Imagine you are looking at a page
that is divided into 4 distinct areas: a cell at the top of the page
that contains a banner and some navigation, and a "body" area that is
divided into three sections consisting of more navigation, an article,
and advertisement.  If point is in the main article cell, using `C-f'
will open another buffer that contains only the text of that cell, the
article you are interested in.

   One caveat is that this does not always work as advertised.
Sometimes the leftmost character of each line is missing.  At least it
makes for interesting reading.  Usually when I have this problem I
simply exit that buffer and linearize the tables in the original page.

   The `m' key executes a very useful command.  It will complete a link
on the page.  Imagine that you are reading through a document and you
hear a link that you need to visit.  You could tab through all the
links until you hear the one you want or you could hit the `m' key and
enter the link text at the prompt.  Completion is available and it is
not case-sensitive.  Efficient, no?

   The period in a cell will speak the contents of that particular cell.
This command is, in my opinion, most useful when navigating tables with
cells that have only one paragraph or less.  I tend to not read whole
articles in this manner because, inevitably, someone will interrupt me
and I will lose my place.

   The equals key, while in a table cell will give you the cell
information.  It tells you the row and column position, the size of the
table, and at what nesting level the table is.

   The pipe key, is used to read the table column.  As this command
seems to read the rectangle the column is in, this command is most
useful when used in a table where there is no column spanning, i.e. all
rows and columns are uniform.

   Here is a list of table navigation commands:

   * `C-e +' moves to the beginning of the next table row.

   * `C-e -' moves to the beginning of the previous table row.

   * `C-e <' moves to the beginning of the table.

   * `C-e >' moves to the end of the table.

   * `C-e =' moves to the top of the table column.

   * `C-e <DOWN>' moves to the next cell down in the same column.

   * `C-e <UP>' moves to the previous cell in the same column.

   * `C-e <LEFT>' moves to the previous cell in the same row.

   * `C-e <RIGHT>' moves to the next cell in the same row.

   As you can see, table navigation in w3 can be easy and fun.

emacspeak specific functions for emacs/w3
=========================================

An incredible amount of work has been done by the emacspeak community
to make emacs/w3 accessible to those with visual impairments.  Here is
an explanation of some of those functions.

   The command `C-t' will toggle the visibility of table borders.  This
command might be useful where you want to hear all punctuation symbols
on a page but the table characters get in the way.

   The quote key will execute a command that allows you to skim the
contents of the buffer.  it will read the page, paragraph-by-paragraph,
pausing between paragraphs to prompt you to move on by pressing
<SPACE>.  If you hit <SPACE> in the middle of a paragraph, it skips to
the next paragraph.

   Another skimming command is bound to the `z' key.  This will allow
you to zip through web pages by logical blocks such as div, paragraph,
and table tags.

   Using the imenu facilities is another way of skimming the document
and getting to the information you desire.  imenu works especially well
for well-structured documents.  The first thing that need be done is to
copy the `w3-imenu.el' file from the `contrib' directory of the `w3'
directory to somewhere in your load path.  I am using the cvs version
of w3 and my w3 directory is under `/home/rdc/sourceforge'.  The
easiest thing to do is probably to do an `M-x locate' and search for
`w3-imenu.el' to see where it is.  After locating the file, move it
into your load path.  In my case I have it under
`/home/rdc/share/emacs/site-lisp/'.

   There are two ways to use the imenu facilities: automatically and
manually.  Since I do not use imenu on every site, I prefer to invoke
it manually to save the time required to build the index.

   Once things are in place, invoke imenu with the `j' key.  This will
ask you for an index position.  Hitting <TAB> will give you a list of
the possible index positions.  Another way of navigating the document
would now be to use the keys `M-n' and `M-p' to go to the next and
previous index positions.  Note that you have to build an index for a
page before you can use these commands.

   `Cap A' and `cap R' serve the same function.  `Cap A' browses the
Atom feed at point and `cap R' browses the rss feed at point.  This is
useful to sample the feed, so to speak, before going through the
trouble of configuring your feed reader to fetch the feed.  It might
also be useful to grab the headlines from a page and present them in a
more concise, readable format.  If using the sort-tables xsl transform,
there will be a link at the top of the page if there is an rss feed
available.  See *Note emacspeak atom and emacspeak rss: rss, for more
information.

   Google provides many useful tools for web surfers.  The following
commands are useful to access much google goodness.

   `Cap C' extracts the current page from the google cache.  With a
prefix argument it will extract the link under point.  This is useful
for those times when a particular site is down... maybe it is in the
cache... maybe it is not.  It can also be used for when particular
pages are removed from a site like in the case of a government
conspiracy.  Are we at war with Eurasia or East Asia?

   The slash key will search google for pages similar to the current
page.

   The command `g' will do a google search restricted to the site of the
document.

   The `l' command googles for who links to this page.

   The command `t' runs the url under point through the google
transcoder.  This is useful for sites that are heavy on the use of
tables and the xsl transforms are not helpful.  It also works on some
sites that use javascript to go to the next page in the story, such as
Reuters.  Using a prefix argument with this command will untranscode
the url under point for pages that are currently transcoded.

   `Cap T' will jump to the first occurance of the title in the
document.  Multiple consecutive executions of this command will jump to
further occurances.  This command is probably one of the most useful
timesavers while web browsing.

   `M-s' jumps to the "submit" button for the form you are editing.

   `M-r' plays the media stream at point with the default media player.

   The `y' command will rewrite the url of the url under point.  This is
useful for those sites you frequent.  Often, sites that have printer
friendly content have a specific way in which the url is written.  For
example,  the O'Reilly web site uses "pub" for the regular html version
of a page and "lpt" for the printer friendly version.  Examine these
urls:

`http://www.oreillynet.com/lpt/a/wireless/2001/03/02/802.11b_facts.html'

`http://www.oreillynet.com/lpt/a/wireless/2001/03/02/802.11b_facts.html'

   The first link goes to the regular version of the page and the second
to the printer friendly version.  Sometimes it is difficult to figure
out the formula, so this is only useful if this is a site that you are
visiting rather often, as the time to figure out the formula on a site
that you rarely visit is far greater than the time you save.

   The first time you run this command in a particular buffer you are
prompted for a pattern to use.  The pattern is in the form of

   `("from string" "to string")'

   The opening paren is supplied.  Remember to quote the strings or you
will get an error.  From this point on, until you kill the buffer in
which you wrote the rule, hitting `y' on a link will use this rewrite
rule to visit the page.  If you mistyped the rule, providing a numeric
argument will allow you to rewrite the rewrite rule.  I love
alliteration.

   Saving the best for last, `e' is the xsl map prefix.  As I mentioned
in the section on emacs-w3m, xsl transforms are some powerful magic
that takes a web page and transforms it in some way.  Linearizing
tables is a good example, and the one I use most often.

   The keystroke `e a' prompts for an xsl transform to apply to the
current page.  If you know the name of the particular transform you
want you can use tab completion to select it.  Otherwise, you can hit
<TAB> to get a buffer that contains the list of choices.

   If you know that you want a particular transform done automatically
you can use the command `e s' to select a transform and then `e o' to
turn xslt on (the same command will turn xslt off).  Then, every page
opened from that point on will have the transform applied.

   There is the variable `emacspeak-w3-xsl-transform' that can be set
via the usual methods.  This variable specifies a transform to use
before displaying a web page.  There is an advantage to turning on xsl
transforms all the time.  If you use the `identity.xsl', the
`linearize-tables.xsl' or the `sort-tables.xsl' it can actually speed
up rendering of the page.  This is because the transforms provide clean
and balanced html to the renderer.  Additionally, using
`sort-tables.xsl' or `linearize-tables.xsl' will provide a little more
boost as rendering nested tables is particularly difficult for a web
browser.

   Sometimes it is just easier to read the printer friendly version of a
story instead of having to linearize the tables and search for the
content.  Also, some sites, like the New York Times, I believe, make
you navigate several pages to read the whole story, but if you select a
"Print this story" link you can read the entire story on one page
formatted without a lot of the cruft on the normal page.  This is where
the `e Cap P'  command comes in.  It will extract all the print streams
from the current document.

   Closely associated commands are `e r' and `e Cap R' which extract the
media streams from the current page and from the link under point,
respectively.

   The command `e y' is another command that is useful for frequented
sites.  It does the same as the `y' command above in that it rewrites
the url at point and follows it.  In addition, it filters the output by
a particular CSS class.

   The command `e e' does more magic to the url at point.  It processes
the url using a specific function.  For example, it can be used in
retrieving radio content from the BBC.  If you execute `C-e u' and type
in `BBC Channel On Demand' or use tab completion to get the same, and
then type in `radio4' you will be presented with a page containing a
plethora of links to other pages containing information about
particular shows.  On these pages there is, somewhere, a link that will
play the program.  If you hit enter on one of the links on the first
page, you will be taken to one of these description pages.  By using
the `e e' command on a link you cut out this middle step and proceed
directly to playing the program you are interested in.

   If there is no executor defined for a current buffer, hitting <TAB>
after `e e' will give you a list of possibilities to choose from.  One
nice feature of this function is that it can be used for any function.
If you cannot remember the keystroke that will play the url under point
in `emacspeak-m-player', but you know what it is called, you can hit `e
e' and then enter the name of the function.  Nice.

   The `e f' command will run the current page through an XPath filter
and return the results.  For more information on XPath, see
`http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XPath'.  If you wanted to see only the
links on a page, when prompted enter `//a' and you will be returned
every link on the page.  If you wanted to see only the contents of "p"
tags, you would enter `//p'.  This can be useful for many things, form
elements included.  Giving this command a prefix argument will reverse
the filter, giving you everything but the content of the specified tag.

   A related command can be invoked with the `e p' keystroke.  This
command does the same as the filter above but works on the url under
point.

emacs/w3 tips and tricks
========================

As I mentioned above, using `C-g' when it seems the browser is not
responding will often display the page with no ill effects.  Your
mileage may vary.  Taxes, tags and title are extra.

   Also mentioned above is the use of sort-tables or identity as an xsl
transform to speed up the rendering of pages.  Every little bit helps.

   Another useful tip is the use of the `k' key.  This key will place
the current url in the kill-ring for later yanking.  If a page will not
render correctly, using `k' will get the url and allow me to pass it to
emacs-w3m.  The counterpart to this command, `cap K' puts the url under
point in the kill-ring.

9.4.4 Add-ons
-------------

Some of these are emacspeak specific, some are not.  You can usually
tell by the name.

emacspeak url template
======================

I love this package.  Since changing my primary browser to emacs/w3 I
have really been giving the `url-template' package a workout.  The
`url-template' package contains templates that prompt you for
information to supply to various sites to retrieve information without
all the fuss of having to go to the site and navigate it.  One really
nice thing about url-templates is the fact that they need not be web
pages.  Media streams can also be made into url-templates.

   The way to get to the templates is with the command `C-e u'.  A
<TAB> at the prompt will give you a list of the available templates.
You should go now and have a look at the info manual section on *Note
URL Templates: URL Templates,  and read it.  I'll wait here.

   By the way, the ones I find most useful are the "Google Hits",
"emacswiki search" "NPR On Demand" and "Weather forecast from Weather
Underground".

emacspeak atom and emacspeak rss
================================

These are fairly simple rss and atom browsers for the emacspeak
desktop.  Using the Customize interface you add feeds in the form of
titles and urls.  Then you call the readers with `C-e C-u' for rss
feeds and use `M-x emacspeak-atom-browse' for atom feeds.  There is also
emacspeak support for newsticker, an rss / atom reader that is a part
of emacs 22, but I have never used it.

   I personally use *note gnus: (gnus)Top, for rss feeds but setting
gnus up for only that purpose is like hunting rabbits with a bazooka.

emacspeak websearch
===================

`emacspeak-websearch' provides more search options than you can shake a
stick at.  `emacspeak-websearch' provides search for dictionaries, news
sites, software sites, google tools, weather, currency converter and
much more.  It can be accessed with the keystroke `C-e ?'.  At the
prompt, you can enter another question mark to get a list of the
available search options.  You will then be prompted for the necessary
information.  One of the nice things about this package is that, when
using w3 it attempts to jump to and read the most relevant information
on the result page.

   *Note emacspeak-websearch: emacspeak-websearch, for more information.

bmk-mgr
=======

This is a newcomer to the emacspeak world.  In the interest of full
disclosure, I am the one that wrote the emacspeak module that makes
this package accessible.  It is a bookmarks manager that works with
both emacs/w3 and emacs-w3m.  As of the writing of this document there
are still some issues, especially when using it on emacs version 22,
but those are being worked on.  I think this is a good solution to the
problem of emacs/w3 not having bookmarks functionality and providing
one central bookmark location for those who regularly use both
browsers.  See `http://www.emacswiki.org/cgi-bin/wiki/EmacsBmkMgr', for
more information.

9.4.5 Conclusion
----------------

emacspeak makes the internet not only accessible to those with visual
impairments, but it makes browsing and information retrieval quick and
efficient.  If a user will spend a little time up front to learn the
tools available to access the web, the increase in efficiency and
ability will more than make up for the time spent.  The nice thing
about these tools is that you can integrate them in your day-to-day as
you have the time.  While it is not necessary to use everything
mentioned in the above document, if you add some of these tools to your
repertoire you will not be sorry.

   In the end, no one makes you use a hammer to drive nails but it sure
beats using a banana.

9.5 Electronic Messaging Applications
=====================================

Working with messaging applications involves both authoring and browsing
content.  Emacspeak provides a rich set of speech-enabled messaging
tools.  Further, all of the tools described in the previous sections
integrate smoothly with the messaging applications described here; this
means that you do not need to re-learn a new set of work habits when
dealing with content in your messaging application.

9.6 Editting Program Source Code
================================

Files containing program source code form a very specific class of
structured documents.  Unlike documents meant for human consumption
that are often only loosely structured, program source (as a concession
to the computer's intolerance of lack of structure) are per force
well-structured and adhere to a fairly stringent  syntax.

   The Emacs environment provides editting modes that are specific to
creating and maintaining software written in most popular programming
languages. Many of these editting modes are speech-enabled by Emacspeak.
Speech-enabling these modes includes providing a rich set of
navigational  commands that allow you to move through the source
efficiently. In addition, Emacspeak's core voice-lock facilities are
used to produce audio formatted output -this helps you spot errors
quickly.

9.10 Desktop Applications
=========================

9.10.1 Spread Sheets
--------------------

Spreadsheet applications present a two dimensional view of structured
data where the field values are (possibly) mutually dependent.  On the
Emacspeak desktop, a speech-enabled spreadsheet application can be used
to manipulate such data-driven documents% ranging from simple cheque
books and expense reports to  complex investment portfolios.  Where the
traditional visual interface to spreadsheets is typically independent
of the semantics of the data stored in the spreadsheet, the
speech-enabled interface is derived from the _ meaning_ of the various
fields making up the data.   When presenting such information on a
visual display, implicit visual layout can be used to cue the user to
the meaning of different data fields.  On the other hand, in the case
of an actively scrolling auditory display, the spoken output needs to
explicitly convey both the value and interpretation of the different
data items.  In addition, the interface needs to enable an active
dialogue between user and application where the user is able to query
the system about the possible meaning of a particular item of data.
Finally, the aural interface needs to enable _ multiple_ views of the
display.  In the visual interface, such _ multiple_ views are
automatically enabled by the two dimensional layout combined with the
eye's ability to move rapidly around the layout structure.  Thus, while
viewing any particular row of a portfolio, one can immediately see the
current total value as well as the net gain or loss.  The Emacs
spread-sheet package `dismal' can be retrieved from
`ftp://cs.nyu.edu/pub/local/fox/dismal'.

9.10.2 Forms Mode
-----------------

_ Forms_ mode  an Emacs mode designed to edit structured data records
like the line shown from file ` /etc/passwd' presents a user-friendly
visual interface that displays the field name along with the field
value.  The user can edit the field value and save the file, at which
point the data is written out using the underlying ` :' delimited
representation.  Mode _ forms_ provides a flexible interface to
associating meaning to the fields of such structured data files.  For
details on it use, see the forms-mode section of the online Emacs info
documentation.

9.10.3 OCR -Reading Print Documents
-----------------------------------

Module `emacspeak-ocr' implements an OCR front-end for the Emacspeak
desktop.

   Page image is acquired using tools from package `SANE' (Scanner
Access Now Easy).  The acquired image is run through the OCR engine if
one is available, and the results placed in a buffer that is suitable
for browsing the results. This buffer is placed in mode
`emacspeak-ocr-mode' a specialized mode for reading and scanning
documents.

9.10.3.1 Emacspeak OCR Mode
...........................

Emacspeak OCR mode is a special major  mode for document scanning and
OCR.

   Pre-requisites:

   * A working scanner back-end like SANE on Linux.

   * An OCR engine.

   Make sure your scanner back-end works, and that you have the
utilities to scan a document and acquire an image as a tiff file.  Then
set variable EMACSPEAK-OCR-SCAN-IMAGE-PROGRAM to point at this utility.
By default, this is set to `scanimage' which is the image scanning
utility provided by SANE.

   By default, this front-end attempts to compress the acquired tiff
image; make sure you have a utility like `tiffcp'.  Variable
EMACSPEAK-OCR-COMPRESS-IMAGE is set to `tiffcp' by default; if you use
something else, you should customize this variable.

   Next, make sure you have an OCR engine installed and working.  By
default this front-end assumes that OCR is available as `/usr/bin/ocr'.

   Once you have ensured that acquiring an image and applying OCR to it
work independently of Emacs, you can use this Emacspeak front-end to
enable easy OCR access from within Emacspeak.

   The Emacspeak OCR front-end is launched by command "emacspeak-ocr"
bound to `C-e C-o'.

   This command switches to a special buffer that has OCR commands
bounds to single keystrokes- see the key-binding list at the end of
this description.  Use Emacs online help facility to look up help on
these commands.

   Mode "emacspeak-ocr-mode" provides the necessary functionality to
scan, OCR, read and save documents.  By default, scanned images and the
resulting text are saved under directory `~/ocr'; see variable
EMACSPEAK-OCR-WORKING-DIRECTORY.  Invoking command
"emacspeak-ocr-open-working-directory" bound to `d' will open this
directory.

   By default, the document being scanned is named `untitled'.  You can
name the document by using command "emacspeak-ocr-name-document" bound
to `n'.  The document name is used in constructing the name of the
image and text files.

   Here is a list of all emacspeak OCR commands along with their

10 Running Terminal Based Applications.
***************************************

You can use the terminal emulator mode to run arbitrary terminal-based
programs from within Emacs.  You open a terminal emulator buffer using
M-x term, with an extra carriage return to accept the default shell
(such as bash).  (Incidentally, don't confuse this command with M-x
terminal-emulator, which starts an older terminal emulator mode not
supported by Emacspeak.)

   Three kinds of commands are used within the terminal emulator.
Normal term commands use a prefix of C-c.  The emacspeak commands for
eterm mode use a prefix of C-t.  Anything else is a normal shell
command.

   There are two sub-modes of term mode: char sub-mode and line
sub-mode.  In char sub-mode, emacspeak will only speak the final chunk
of output -typically the last line displayed.  Each character typed
(except `term-escape-char`) is sent immediately.  Use char sub-mode for
screen oriented programs like vi or pine.

   In line sub-mode, program output is spoken if user option
`eterm-autospeak' is turned on.  When you type a return at the end  of
the buffer, that line is sent as input, while return not at end  copies
the rest of the line to the end and sends it.  When using terminal line
mode with option `eterm-autospeak' turned  on, speech feedback is
similar to that obtained in regular `shell-mode'  buffers.

   The default is char sub-mode.  You can switch to line sub-mode with
C-c C-j (recall that control J is a linefeed), and back to char sub-mode
with C-c C-k (think of character spelled with a K).

   Note:  Use char-mode with the terminal emulator for running
screen-oriented programs like Lynx or Pine.  For regular shell
interaction just use M-x shell instead of using the terminal emulator.

10.1 Char Sub-mode of Term Mode
===============================

In char sub-mode of term, each character you type is sent directly to
the inferior process without intervention from emacs, except for the
escape character (usually C-c).

   Here are some of the useful commands for the char sub-mode.  Note
that the usual commands for killing a buffer or switching buffers do
not work in this mode, so new key bindings are supplied.  The first
five commands are different ways of leaving this mode.

`C-c C-j'
`M-x term-line-mode'
     Switch to line sub-mode of term mode.

`C-c o'
`M-x other-window'
     Select the next window on this frame.  All windows on current
     frame are arranged in a cyclic order.  This command selects the
     next window in that order.  If there are no other windows, this
     command does nothing.

`C-c C-f'
`M-x find-file'
     Switch to a buffer visiting a file, creating one if none already
     exists.

`C-c 0'
`M-x delete-window'
     Remove current window from the display.

`C-c k'
`M-x kill-buffer'
     Kill the current buffer.

`C-c C-x C-c'
`M-x save-buffers-kill-emacs'
     Offer to save each buffer, then kill this Emacs process.

`C-c C-d'
`M-x list-directory'
     Display a list of files in or matching DIRNAME, a la `ls'.
     DIRNAME is globbed by the shell if necessary.  Prefix arg (C-u)
     means supply -l switch to `ls'.  The list appears in a second
     window.

`C-c 1'
`M-x delete-other-windows'
     Delete all other windows in the frame, making the current window
     fill its frame.

`C-c C-c'
`M-x term-send-raw'
     Send the last character typed through the terminal-emulator
     without any interpretation.

`C-c ('
`M-x start-kbd-macro'
     Record subsequent keyboard input, defining a keyboard macro.  The
     commands are recorded even as they are executed.  Use C-c ) to
     finish recording and make the macro available.  Use M-x
     name-last-kbd-macro to give it a permanent name.  Prefix arg (C-u)
     means append to last macro defined; This begins by re-executing
     that macro as if you had typed it again.

`C-c )'
`M-x end-kbd-macro'
     Finish defining a keyboard macro.  The definition was started by
     C-c (.  The macro is now available for use via C-c e, or it can be
     given a name with M-x name-last-kbd-macro and then invoked under
     that name.

`C-c e'
`M-x call-last-kbd-macro'
     Call the last keyboard macro that you defined with C-c (.  A
     prefix argument serves as a repeat count.  Zero means repeat until
     error.

   You can get a list of all the key sequences with a C-c prefix by
typing C-c C-h while in this sub-mode.  Some of those commands are only
available in the char sub-mode, while others are generally available.

10.2 Line Sub-mode of Term Mode
===============================

In line sub-mode of term mode, emacs editing commands work normally,
until you type RET which sends the current line to the inferior process.

   Here are some of the useful commands for the line sub-mode of the
term mode.  In addition, the usual commands for handling a buffer work
in this mode (C-x o to switch windows, C-x k to kill a buffer, C-x f to
find a file, and so forth).

`C-c C-k'
`M-x term-char-mode'
     Switch to char sub-mode of term mode.

`C-c C-z'
`M-x term-stop-subjob'
     Stop the current subjob.  Resume the subjob in the foreground with
     the ordinary command fg, or run it in the background with bg.
     WARNING: if there is no current subjob, you can end up suspending
     the top-level process running in the buffer. If you accidentally
     do this, use M-x term-continue-subjob to resume the process. (This
     is not a problem with with most shells, including bash, since they
     ignore this signal.)

`C-c C-\'
`M-x term-quit-subjob'
     Send quit signal to the current subjob.

`C-c C-c'
`M-x term-interrupt-subjob'
     Interrupt the current subjob.

`C-c C-w'
`M-x backward-kill-word'
     Kill characters backward until encountering the end of a word.

`C-c C-u'
`M-x term-kill-input'
     Kill all text from last stuff output by interpreter to point.

`C-c C-a'
`M-x term-bol'
     Goes to the beginning of line, then skips past the prompt, if any.
     If a prefix argument is given (C-u), then no prompt skip - go
     straight to column 0.

`C-c C-d'
`M-x term-send-eof'
     Send an end of file character (EOF) to the current buffer's
     process.

   You can get a list of all the key sequences with a C-c prefix by
typing C-c C-h while in this sub-mode.  Some of those commands are only
available in the line sub-mode, while others are generally available.

10.3 Eterm Mode Commands
========================

The eterm mode maintains a pointer, which is not necessarily the same as
the terminal's cursor.  It is intended to be used in eterm's char
submode.  In char submode, C-t , (that's control-t followed by comma)
will tell you where the eterm pointer is.  C-t C-i will tell you where
the terminal's cursor is.  The top left corner of the window is "row 0
column 0".

   The eterm pointer can be moved with C-t < (to the top of the screen),
C-t > (to the bottom of the screen), C-t n (to the next line), C-t p (to
the previous line), and C-t . (to the cursor).  Each of these also
speaks the line the pointer moves to.  You can also search forward with
C-t s.

   These commands speak without moving the pointer: C-t l (current
line), C-t w (current word), C-t c (current character), and C-t [space]
(from eterm pointer to cursor).

   You may enter review mode with C-t q.  In review mode, you can search
the buffer and speak its contents, without disturbing the terminal.
Commands for moving the pointer are similar to normal editing commands,
but without a control key: n and p for next and previous line, f and b
for forward and back by characters, < and > for the beginning or end of
the buffer.  c, w, and l speak the current character, word, and line.  s
searches forward (not incrementally).  A comma speaks the pointer
location.  A period moves the pointer to the terminal cursor.  Return to
normal term mode by typing q.

11.3 dtk-speak
==============

Commentary: Defines the TTS interface.

   Automatically generated documentation for commands defined in module
dtk-speak.

 -- Interactive Command: dtk-add-cleanup-pattern nil
     ` control e d a '

     Add this pattern to the list of repeating patterns that are
     cleaned up.  Optional interactive prefix arg deletes this pattern
     if previously added.  Cleaning up repeated patterns results in
     emacspeak speaking the pattern followed by a repeat count instead
     of speaking all the characters making up the pattern.  Thus, by
     adding the repeating pattern `.' (this is already added by
     default) emacspeak will say "aw fifteen dot" when speaking the
     string "..............." instead of "period period period period "

 -- Interactive Command: dtk-async-server nil
     ` control e d  cap A  '

     Select and start an async  speech server interactively.  Async
     servers allow external programs like self-voicing Web browsers to
     use the Emacspeak TTS server abstraction.  Argument PROGRAM
     specifies the speech server program.

 -- Interactive Command: dtk-local-server nil
     ` control e d  cap L  '

     Select and start an local  speech server interactively.  Local
     server lets Emacspeak on a remote host connect back via SSH  port
     forwarding for instance.  Argument PROGRAM specifies the speech
     server program.  Port  defaults to  dtk-local-server-port

 -- Interactive Command: dtk-pause nil
     ` control e p '

     Temporarily pause / rsume speech.

 -- Interactive Command: dtk-reset-state nil
     ` control e d  cap R  '

     Restore sanity to the Dectalk.  Typically used after the Dectalk
     has been power   cycled.

 -- Interactive Command: dtk-resume nil
     `Not bound to any key.'

     Resume paused speech.  This command resumes  speech that has been
     suspended by executing command `dtk-pause' bound to C-e p.  If
     speech has not been paused, and option `dtk-resume-should-toggle'
     is set,  then this command will pause ongoing speech.

 -- Interactive Command: dtk-select-server nil
     ` control e d d '

     Select a speech server interactively.  Argument PROGRAM specifies
     the speech server program. When called interactively, The selected
     server is started immediately. Optional arg device sets up
     environment variable ALSA_DEFAULT to specified device before
     starting the server.

 -- Interactive Command: dtk-set-character-scale nil
     ` control e d f '

     Set scale FACTOR for   speech rate.  Speech rate is scaled by this
     factor when speaking characters.  Interactive PREFIX arg means set
      the global default value, and then set the current local  value
     to the result.

 -- Interactive Command: dtk-set-chunk-separator-syntax nil
     ` control e d RETURN '

     Interactively set how text is split in chunks.  See the Emacs
     documentation on syntax tables for details on how characters are
     classified into various syntactic classes.  Argument S specifies
     the syntax class.

 -- Interactive Command: dtk-set-language nil
     ` control e d  cap S  '

     Set language according to the argument lang.

 -- Interactive Command: dtk-set-next-language nil
     ` control e d  cap N  '

     Switch to the next available language

 -- Interactive Command: dtk-set-predefined-speech-rate nil
     ` control e d 9   control e d 8   control e d 7   control e d 6
     control e d 5   control e d 4   control e d 3   control e d 2
     control e d 1   control e d 0 '

     Set speech rate to one of nine predefined levels.  Interactive
     PREFIX arg says to set the rate globally.  Formula used is: rate =
     dtk-speech-rate-base + dtk-speech-rate-step * level.

 -- Interactive Command: dtk-set-preferred-language nil
     `Not bound to any key.'

     Set the alias of the preferred language: For example if alias="en"
     lang="en_GB", then the following call:  dtk-set-language("en")
     will set "en_GB".


 -- Interactive Command: dtk-set-previous-language nil
     ` control e d  cap P  '

     Switch to the previous available language

 -- Interactive Command: dtk-set-punctuations nil
     ` control e d p '

     Set punctuation mode to MODE.  Possible values are `some', `all',
     or `none'.  Interactive PREFIX arg means set   the global default
     value, and then set the current local  value to the result.

 -- Interactive Command: dtk-set-punctuations-to-all nil
     `Not bound to any key.'

     Set punctuation  mode to all.  Interactive PREFIX arg sets
     punctuation mode globally.

 -- Interactive Command: dtk-set-punctuations-to-some nil
     `Not bound to any key.'

     Set punctuation  mode to some.  Interactive PREFIX arg sets
     punctuation mode globally.

 -- Interactive Command: dtk-set-rate nil
     ` control e d r '

     Set speaking RATE for the tts.  Interactive PREFIX arg means set
     the global default value, and then set the current local  value to
     the result.

 -- Interactive Command: dtk-stop nil
     ` control e s '

     Stop speech now.

 -- Interactive Command: dtk-toggle-allcaps-beep nil
     ` control e d  cap C  '

     Toggle allcaps-beep.  when set, allcaps words  are  indicated by a
     short beep.  Interactive PREFIX arg means toggle the global default
     value, and then set the current local value to the result.  Note
     that allcaps-beep is a very useful thing when programming.
     However it is irritating to have it on when reading documents.

 -- Interactive Command: dtk-toggle-capitalization nil
     ` control e d c '

     Toggle capitalization.  when set, capitalization is indicated by a
     short beep.  Interactive PREFIX arg means toggle the global default
     value, and then set the current local value to the result.

 -- Interactive Command: dtk-toggle-debug nil
     ` control e d b '

     Toggle state of the debug FLAG.  When debugging is on, you can
     switch to the buffer *speaker* to examine the output from the
     process that talks to the speech device by using command C-e d
     C-M-b.  Note: *speaker* is a hidden buffer, ie it has a leading
     space in its name.

 -- Interactive Command: dtk-toggle-punctuation-mode nil
     ` control e d , '

     Toggle punctuation mode between "some" and "all".  Interactive
     PREFIX arg makes the new setting global.

 -- Interactive Command: dtk-toggle-quiet nil
     ` control e d q '

     Toggles state of  dtk-quiet.  Turning on this switch silences
     speech.  Optional interactive prefix arg causes this setting to
     become global.

 -- Interactive Command: dtk-toggle-speak-nonprinting-chars nil
     ` control e d n '

     Toggle speak-nonprinting-chars.  Switches behavior of how
     characters with the high bit set are handled.  Interactive PREFIX
     arg means toggle the global default value, and then set the
     current local value to the result.

 -- Interactive Command: dtk-toggle-split-caps nil
     ` control e d s '

     Toggle split caps mode.  Split caps mode is useful when reading
     Hungarian notation in program source code.  Interactive PREFIX arg
     means toggle the global default value, and then set the current
     local value to the result.

 -- Interactive Command: dtk-toggle-splitting-on-white-space nil
     ` control e d SPACE '

     Toggle splitting of speech on white space.  This affects the
     internal state of emacspeak that decides if we split text purely
     by clause boundaries, or also include whitespace.  By default,
     emacspeak sends a clause at a time to the speech device.  This
     produces fluent speech for normal use.  However in modes such as
     `shell-mode' and some programming language modes, clause markers
     appear infrequently, and this can result in large amounts of text
     being sent to the speech device at once, making the system
     unresponsive when asked to stop talking.  Splitting on white space
     makes emacspeak's stop command responsive.  However, when
     splitting on white space, the speech sounds choppy since the
     synthesizer is getting a word at a time.

 -- Interactive Command: dtk-toggle-strip-octals nil
     ` control e d o '

     Toggle stripping of octals.  Interactive prefix arg means  toggle
     the global default value, and then set the current local value to
     the result.

=====================

Commentary: Ediff provides a nice visual interface to diff.
;;;Comparing and patching files is easy with ediff when you can see the
screen.  This module provides Emacspeak extensions to work fluently
with ediff. Try it out, it's an excellent example of why Emacspeak is
better than a traditional screenreader.  This module was originally
written to interface to the old ediff.el bundled with GNU Emacs 19.28
and earlier.  It has been updated to work with the newer and much
larger ediff system found in Emacs 19.29 and later.

====================

Commentary: In celebration of a million books and more to read from
Google Books The EPubs format is slightly simpler than full Daisy --
(see) emacspeak-daisy.el Since it only needs one level of indirection
(no audio, therefore no smil). This module is consequently simpler than
emacspeak-daisy.el.  This module will eventually  implement the Google
Books  API -- probably by invoking the yet-to-be-written gbooks.el in
emacs-g-client As we move to epub-3, this module will bring back audio
layers etc., perhaps via a simplified smil implementation.

11.33 emacspeak-gridtext
========================

Commentary: Emacspeak's table browsing mode allows one to efficiently
access  content that is tabular in nature.  That module also provides
functions for infering table structure where possible.  Often, such
structure is hard to infer automatically -but might be known to the user
e.g. treat columns 1 through 30 as one column of a table and so on.
This module allows the user to specify a conceptual grid that is
"overlaid" on the region of text to turn it into a table for tabular
browsing. For now, elements of the grid are "one line" high -but that
may change in the future if necessary. This module is useful for
browsing structured text files and the output from programs that
tabulate their output.  It's also useful for handling multicolumn text.

====================

Commentary: Flexible hide and show for emacspeak.  This module allows
one to easily hide or expose blocks of lines starting with a common
prefix.  It is motivated by the need to flexibly hide quoted text in
email but is designed to be more general.  the prefix parsing is
inspired by filladapt.el

   Automatically generated documentation for commands defined in module
emacspeak-hide.

 -- Interactive Command: emacspeak-hide-or-expose-all-blocks nil
     `Not bound to any key.'

     Hide or expose all blocks in buffer.

 -- Interactive Command: emacspeak-hide-or-expose-block nil
     ` control e j '

     Hide or expose a block of text.  This command either hides or
     exposes a block of text starting on the current line.  A block of
     text is defined as a portion of the buffer in which all lines
     start with a common PREFIX.  Optional interactive prefix arg
     causes all blocks in current buffer to be hidden or exposed.

 -- Interactive Command: emacspeak-hide-speak-block-sans-prefix nil
     ` control e control j '

     Speaks current block after stripping its prefix.  If the current
     block is not hidden, it first hides it.  This is useful because as
     you locate blocks, you can invoke this command to listen to the
     block, and when you have heard enough navigate easily  to move
     past the block.

===================

Commentary: This module defines Emacspeak front-end to OCR.  This
module assumes that sane is installed and working for image acquisition,
and that there is an OCR engine that can take acquired images and
produce text.  Prerequisites: Sane installed and working.  scanimage to
generate tiff files from scanner.  tiffcp to compress the tiff file.
working ocr executable by default this module assumes that the OCR
executable is named "ocr"

   Automatically generated documentation for commands defined in module
emacspeak-ocr.

 -- Interactive Command: emacspeak-ocr nil
     ` control e control o '

     An OCR front-end for the Emacspeak desktop.

     Page image is acquired using tools from the SANE package.  The
     acquired image is run through the OCR engine if one is available,
     and the results placed in a buffer that is suitable for browsing
     the results.

     For detailed help, invoke command emacspeak-ocr bound to C-e C-o
     to launch emacspeak-ocr-mode, and press `?' to display
     mode-specific help for emacspeak-ocr-mode.

 -- Interactive Command: emacspeak-ocr-backward-page nil
     `Not bound to any key.'

     Like backward page, but tracks page number of current document.

 -- Interactive Command: emacspeak-ocr-customize nil
     `Not bound to any key.'

     Customize OCR settings.

 -- Interactive Command: emacspeak-ocr-flipflop-and-recognize-image nil
     `Not bound to any key.'

     Run OCR engine on current image after flip-flopping it.  Useful if
     you've scanned a page upside down and are using an engine that
     does not automatically flip the image for you.  You need the
     imagemagik family of tools -- we use mogrify to transform the
     image.  Prompts for image file if file corresponding to the
     expected `current page' is not found.

 -- Interactive Command: emacspeak-ocr-forward-page nil
     `Not bound to any key.'

     Like forward page, but tracks page number of current document.

 -- Interactive Command: emacspeak-ocr-mode nil
     `Not bound to any key.'

     An OCR front-end for the Emacspeak desktop.

     Pre-requisites:

     1) A working scanner back-end like SANE on Linux.

     2) An OCR engine.

     1: Make sure your scanner back-end works, and that you have the
     utilities to scan a document and acquire an image as a tiff file.
     Then set variable emacspeak-ocr-scan-image-program to point at
     this utility.  By default, this is set to `scanimage' which is the
     image scanning utility provided by SANE.

     By default, this front-end attempts to compress the acquired tiff
     image; make sure you have a utility like tiffcp.  Variable
     emacspeak-ocr-compress-image is set to `tiffcp' by default; if you
     use something else, you should customize this variable.

     2: Next, make sure you have an OCR engine installed and working.
     By default this front-end assumes that OCR is available as
     /usr/bin/ocr.

     Once you have ensured that acquiring an image and applying OCR to
     it work independently of Emacs, you can use this Emacspeak
     front-end to enable easy OCR access from within Emacspeak.

     The Emacspeak OCR front-end is launched by command emacspeak-ocr
     bound to C-e C-o.

     This command switches to a special buffer that has OCR commands
     bounds to single keystrokes- see the ke-binding list at the end of
     this description.  Use Emacs online help facility to look up help
     on these commands.

     emacspeak-ocr-mode provides the necessary functionality to scan,
     OCR, read and save documents.  By default, scanned images and the
     resulting text are saved under directory ~/ocr; see variable
     emacspeak-ocr-working-directory.  Invoking command
     emacspeak-ocr-open-working-directory bound to M-x
     emacspeak-ocr-open-working-directory will open this directory.

     By default, the document being scanned is named `untitled'.  You
     can name the document by using command emacspeak-ocr-name-document
     bound to M-x emacspeak-ocr-name-document.  The document name is
     used in constructing the name of the image and text files.

     Key Bindings:

     See key             binding --             ------

11.49 emacspeak-pronounce
=========================

Commentary: This module implements user customizable pronunciation
dictionaries for emacspeak. Custom pronunciations can be defined per
file, per directory and/or per major mode. Emacspeak maintains a
persistent user dictionary upon request and loads these in new emacspeak
sessions. This module implements the user interface to the custom
dictionary as well as providing the internal API used by the rest of
emacspeak in using the dictionary.  Algorithm:

   The persistent dictionary is a hash table where the hash keys are
filenames, directory names, or major-mode names. The hash values are
association lists defining the dictionary. Users of this module can
retrieve a dictionary made up of all applicable association lists for a
given file.

     in emacspeak composing a pronunciation table based on the
     currently defined pronunciation dictionaries.  After this, the
     pronunciations will be applied whenever text in the buffer is
     spoken.  Optional argument state can be used from Lisp programs to
     explicitly turn pronunciations on or off.

11.54 emacspeak-sounds
======================

Commentary: This module provides the interface for generating auditory
icons in emacspeak.  Design goal: 1) Auditory icons should be used to
provide additional feedback, not as a gimmick.  2) The interface should
be usable at all times without the icons: e.g. when on a machine
without a sound card.  3) General principle for when to use an icon:
Convey information about events taking place in parallel.  For
instance, if making a selection automatically moves the current focus
to the next choice, We speak the next choice, while indicating the fact
that something was selected with a sound cue.   This interface will
assume the availability of a shell command "play" that can take one or
more sound files and play them.  This module will also provide a
mapping between names in the elisp world and actual sound files.
Modules that wish to use auditory icons should use these names, instead
of actual file names.  As of Emacspeak 13.0, this module defines a
themes architecture for  auditory icons.  Sound files corresponding to
