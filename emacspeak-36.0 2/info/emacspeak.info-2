11.78 voice-setup
=================

Commentary: A voice is to audio as a font is to a visual display.  A
personality is to audio as a face is to a visual display.

   Voice-lock-mode is a minor mode that causes your comments to be
spoken in one personality, strings in another, reserved words in
another, documentation strings in another, and so on.

   Comments will be spoken in
`emacspeak-voice-lock-comment-personality'.  Strings will be spoken in
`emacspeak-voice-lock-string-personality'.  Doc strings will be spoken
in `emacspeak-voice-lock-doc-string-personality'.  Function and
variable names (in their defining forms) will be  spoken in
`emacspeak-voice-lock-function-name-personality'.  Reserved words will
be spoken in `emacspeak-voice-lock-keyword-personality'.

   To make the text you type be voiceified, use M-x voice-lock-mode.
When this minor mode is on, the voices of the current line are updated
with every insertion or deletion.

   How faces map to voices: TTS engine specific modules e.g.,
dectalk-voices.el and outloud-voices.el define a standard set of voice
names.  This module maps standard "personality" names to these
pre-defined voices.  It does this via special form def-voice-font which
takes a personality name, a voice name and a face name to set up the
mapping between face and personality, and personality and voice.  Newer
Emacspeak modules should use voice-setup-add-map when defining
face->personality mappings.  Older code calls def-voice-font directly,
but over time those calls will be changed to the more succinct form
provided by voice-setup-add-map. For use from other moduels, also see
function voice-setup-map-face which is useful when mapping a single
face.  Both voice-setup-add-map and voice-setup-map-face call special
form def-voice-font.

   Special form def-voice-font sets up the personality name to be
available via custom.  new voices can be defined using CSS style
specifications see special form defvoice Voices defined via defvoice
can be customized via custom see the documentation for defvoice.

   Automatically generated documentation for commands defined in module
voice-setup.

 -- Interactive Command: voice-setup-list-voices nil
     `Not bound to any key.'

     Show all defined voice-face mappings  in a help buffer.  Sample
     text to use comes from variable   `voice-setup-sample-text'.

 -- Interactive Command: voice-setup-toggle-silence-personality nil
     ` control e meta q '

     Toggle audibility of personality under point  .  If personality at
     point is currently audible, its face->personality map is cached in
     a buffer local variable, and its face->personality map is replaced
     by face->inaudible.  If personality at point is inaudible, and
     there is a cached value, then the original face->personality
     mapping is restored.  In either case, the buffer is refontified to
     have the new mapping take effect.

=============================

Commentary: This module defines the advice forms for making the core of
Emacs speak Advice forms that are specific to Emacs subsystems do not
belong here!  I violate this at present by advicing completion comint
and shell here.

   Note that we needed to advice a lot more for Emacs  19 and Emacs 20
than we do  for Emacs 21 and Emacs 22.  As of August 2007, this file is
being purged of advice forms not needed in Emacs 22.  This also means
that this and subsequent versions of Emacspeak should not be run on
versions of Emacs older than Emacs 21, And preferably only run on Emacs
22.  This version of Emacspeak is only tested on Emacs 22.

Commentary: In celebration of a million books and more to read from
Google Books The EPubs format is slightly simpler than full Daisy --
(see) emacspeak-daisy.el Since it only needs one level of indirection
(no audio, therefore no smil). This module is consequently simpler than
emacspeak-daisy.el.  This module will eventually  implement the Google
Books  API -- probably by invoking the yet-to-be-written gbooks.el in
emacs-g-client As we move to epub-3, this module will bring back audio
layers etc., perhaps via a simplified smil implementation.

=================================

Commentary: This module implements user customizable pronunciation
dictionaries for emacspeak. Custom pronunciations can be defined per
file, per directory and/or per major mode. Emacspeak maintains a
persistent user dictionary upon request and loads these in new emacspeak
sessions. This module implements the user interface to the custom
dictionary as well as providing the internal API used by the rest of
emacspeak in using the dictionary.  Algorithm:

   The persistent dictionary is a hash table where the hash keys are
filenames, directory names, or major-mode names. The hash values are
association lists defining the dictionary. Users of this module can
retrieve a dictionary made up of all applicable association lists for a
given file.

12.49 emacspeak-sounds Options
==============================

Commentary: This module provides the interface for generating auditory
icons in emacspeak.  Design goal: 1) Auditory icons should be used to
provide additional feedback, not as a gimmick.  2) The interface should
be usable at all times without the icons: e.g. when on a machine
without a sound card.  3) General principle for when to use an icon:
Convey information about events taking place in parallel.  For
instance, if making a selection automatically moves the current focus
to the next choice, We speak the next choice, while indicating the fact
that something was selected with a sound cue.   This interface will
assume the availability of a shell command "play" that can take one or
more sound files and play them.  This module will also provide a
mapping between names in the elisp world and actual sound files.
Modules that wish to use auditory icons should use these names, instead
of actual file names.  As of Emacspeak 13.0, this module defines a
themes architecture for  auditory icons.  Sound files corresponding to
a given theme are found in appropriate subdirectories of
emacspeak-sounds-directory

     /dev/audio is busy.  It's imperative that you use the -i flag to
     play on sparc20's.

 -- Variable: User Option emacspeak-sounds-reset-snd-module-command

12.65 voice-setup Options
=========================

Commentary: A voice is to audio as a font is to a visual display.  A
personality is to audio as a face is to a visual display.

   Voice-lock-mode is a minor mode that causes your comments to be
spoken in one personality, strings in another, reserved words in
another, documentation strings in another, and so on.

   Comments will be spoken in
`emacspeak-voice-lock-comment-personality'.  Strings will be spoken in
`emacspeak-voice-lock-string-personality'.  Doc strings will be spoken
in `emacspeak-voice-lock-doc-string-personality'.  Function and
variable names (in their defining forms) will be  spoken in
`emacspeak-voice-lock-function-name-personality'.  Reserved words will
be spoken in `emacspeak-voice-lock-keyword-personality'.

   To make the text you type be voiceified, use M-x voice-lock-mode.
When this minor mode is on, the voices of the current line are updated
with every insertion or deletion.

   How faces map to voices: TTS engine specific modules e.g.,
dectalk-voices.el and outloud-voices.el define a standard set of voice
names.  This module maps standard "personality" names to these
pre-defined voices.  It does this via special form def-voice-font which
takes a personality name, a voice name and a face name to set up the
mapping between face and personality, and personality and voice.  Newer
Emacspeak modules should use voice-setup-add-map when defining
face->personality mappings.  Older code calls def-voice-font directly,
but over time those calls will be changed to the more succinct form
provided by voice-setup-add-map. For use from other moduels, also see
function voice-setup-map-face which is useful when mapping a single
face.  Both voice-setup-add-map and voice-setup-map-face call special
form def-voice-font.

   Special form def-voice-font sets up the personality name to be
available via custom.  new voices can be defined using CSS style
specifications see special form defvoice Voices defined via defvoice
can be customized via custom see the documentation for defvoice.

13 Emacspeak TTS Servers
************************

Emacspeak produces spoken output by communicating with one of many
  speech servers. This section documents the communication protocol
    between the client application i.e. Emacspeak, and the TTS
server. This section is primarily intended for developers wishing to:
   * Create new speech servers that comply with this communication
       protocol

   * Developers of other client applications   who wish to use
     the various Emacspeak speech servers.

13.0.1 High-level Overview
--------------------------

The TTS server reads commands from standard input, and  script
_speech-server_ can be used  to cause a TTS server to communicate
 via a TCP socket. Speech server commands are used by the client
 application to make specific requests of the server; the server
 listens for these requests in a non-blocking read loop and executes
     requests as they become available. Requests can be classified
   as follows:
   * Commands that send text to be spoken.

   * Commands that set _state_ of the TTS server.

   All commands are of the form
             commandWord {arguments}
           The braces are optional if the command argument contains no
white         space.  The speech server maintains a _current state_ that
       determines various characteristics of spoken output such as
speech         rate, punctuations mode etc. (see set of commands that
manipulate         speech state for complete list).  The client
application _queues_ The         text and non-speech audio output to be
produced before asking the         server to _dispatch_ the set of
queued requests, i.e. start         producing output.

   Once the server has been asked to produce output, it removes items
     from the front of the queue, sends the requisite commands to the
      underlying TTS engine, and waits for the engine to acknowledge
that         the request has been completely processed. This is a
non-blocking         operation, i.e., if the client application
generates additional         requests, these are processed
_immediately_.

   The above design allows the Emacspeak TTS server to be
_highly_ responsive; Cleint applications can queue large
amounts of text (typically queued a clause at a time to         achieve
the best prosody), ask the TTS server to start speaking,         and
interrupt the spoken output at any time.

13.0.2 Commands That Queue Output.

This section documents commands that either produce spoken
output, or queue output to be produced on demand.          Commands
that place the request on the queue are clearly marked.

             version

   Speaks the _version_ of the TTS engine. Produces output
immediately.

             tts_say text

   Speaks the specified _text_ immediately. The text is not
pre-processed in any way, contrast this with the primary way of
speaking text which is to queue text before asking the server to
process the queue.

             l c

   Speak _c_ a single character, as a letter.  The character is
spoken immediately. This command uses the TTS engine's capability to
    speak a single character with the ability to flush speech
_immediately_.  Client applications wishing to produce
character-at-a-time output, e.g., when providing character echo during
      keyboard input should use this command.

             d

   This command is used to _dispatch_ all queued requests.          It
was renamed to a single character command (like many of the
commonly used TTS server commands) to work more effectively over
slow (9600) dialup lines.          The effect of calling this command
is for the TTS server to start         processing items that have been
queued via earlier requests.

             tts_pause

   This pauses speech _immediately_.          It does not affect queued
requests; when command         _tts_resume_ is called, the output
resumes at the point         where it was paused. Not all TTS engines
provide this capability.

             tts_resume

   Resume spoken output if it has been paused earlier.

             s

   Stop speech _immediately_.          Spoken output is interrupted,
and all pending requests are         flushed from the queue.

             q text

   Queues text to be spoken. No spoken output is produced until a
 _dispatch_ request is received via execution of command         _d_.

             a filename

   Cues the audio file identified by filename for playing.

             t freq length

   Queues a tone to be played at the specified frequency and having the
       specified length.  Frequency is specified in hertz and length is
       specified in milliseconds.

             sh duration

   Queues the specified duration of silence. Silence is specified in
    milliseconds.

13.0.3 Commands That Set State
------------------------------

             tts_reset

   Reset TTS engine to  default settings.

             tts_set_punctuations mode

   Sets TTS engine to the specified punctuation mode. Typicaly, TTS
   servers provide at least three modes:
   * None: Do not speak punctuation characters.

   * some: Speak some punctuation characters. Used for English
     prose.

   * all: Speak out _all_ punctuation characters; useful in
     programming modes.

             tts_set_speech_rate rate

   Sets speech rate. The interpretation of this value is typically
  engine specific.

             tts_set_character_scale factor

   Scale factor applied to speech rate when speaking individual
characters.Thus, setting speech rate to 500 and character         scale
to 1.2 will cause command _l_ to use a speech rate         of _500 *
1.2 = 600_.

             tts_split_caps flag

   Set state of _split caps_ processing. Turn this on to         speak
mixed-case (AKA Camel Case) identifiers.

             tts_capitalize flag

   Indicate capitalization via a beep tone or voice  pitch.

             tts_allcaps_beep flag

   Setting this flag produces  a high-pitched beep when speaking words
that are in         all-caps, e.g. abbreviations.
