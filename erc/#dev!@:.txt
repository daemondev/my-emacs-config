         <xyb> py, wangye, 可以用程序扫一遍日记、帖子的cache吗？找出异常的来，
               再全部修掉                                               [15:28]

      <xieshi> xyb: 这个不是cache
      <xieshi> xyb: 是还有一些db的数据没对
          <py> xyb: 现在静态文件的import是可以支持 @import xxx.js 么?
                                                                        [15:31]
         <xyb> xieshi: 从douban db取数据时，会使用 mc 做一次缓存。所以已经被用
               户访问，成为空白正文的数据，都应该在cache中有所体现吧
                                                                        [15:32]
         <xyb> py: 对，是支持的。不过要写成 @import /js/path/to/file.js
          <py> xyb: kejun刚才过来说想支持相对路径引用，现在的 @import
               /js/xxx.js就是绝对路径从static/开始，如果不是/开头，就是相对路径
               引用，你看可以么?                                        [15:34]
